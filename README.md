# Shillings: The JSE Stock Tracker

Initially this application was built to crawl through a web site to identify all CSS styles and to optimize the CSS files to remove irrelevant styles for each page. It was a file optimization tool specifically for decreasing the payload of the CSS files. This application is now used to scrape data from pages that contain data with daily summary of stock trades. It uses a cluster of applications to achieve this objective.
