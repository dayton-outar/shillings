# Shillings: The JSE Stock Tracker

Initially this application was built to crawl through a web site to identify all CSS styles and to optimize the CSS files to remove irrelevant styles for each page. It was a file optimization tool specifically for decreasing the payload of the CSS files. This application is now used to scrape data from pages that contain data with daily summary of stock trades. It uses a cluster of applications to achieve this objective.

## Vision Statement

_To be the complete playground for stock investor's worldwide_

It's a bold vision that is focused on telling the stories of businesses worldwide. That vision starts here in Jamaica.

Indeed! The United States of America has the most advanced systems for stock trading but I think Jamaica has enough sophistication and history to start with a _viable market_ that can springboard and influence this project in a promising direction.

## Mission Statement

How do we achieve such a bold vision?

_Our mission is to empower stock investors globally by providing a comprehensive and innovative platform that offers a story-based approach to understanding the development and performance of businesses. We are committed to fostering a dynamic and supportive community where investors of all levels can learn, collaborate, and thrive, ultimately enabling them to make informed decisions and achieve their financial goals with confidence._
