# Corporate Actions

Corporate actions are events initiated by a publicly traded company that can have an impact on its shareholders and the overall structure of the company. These actions can include events that affect ownership, financial position, and decision-making within the company. Here are some common types of corporate actions:

1. **Dividend Declaration:** Companies may declare dividends to distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders. Dividends can be in the form of cash or additional shares.

2. **Stock Split:** A stock split involves dividing existing shares into multiple shares, often to lower the price per share and make the stock more accessible to investors.

3. **Reverse Stock Split:** In a reverse stock split, multiple shares are consolidated into a single share, usually to increase the stock's price.

4. **Bonus Issue:** Also known as a scrip dividend, this involves issuing additional shares to existing shareholders without requiring payment. It's typically based on the number of shares the shareholder already owns.

5. **Rights Issue:** A company offers existing shareholders the right to purchase additional shares at a discounted price. This can help raise additional capital.

6. **Initial Public Offering (IPO):** The first time a company's shares are offered to the public for trading on a stock exchange.

7. **Secondary Offering:** A company that is already publicly traded may issue additional shares for sale to the public to raise capital.

8. **Merger:** When two companies combine to form a single entity, often resulting in the consolidation of assets, operations, and ownership.

9. **Acquisition:** One company buys a controlling stake in another company, either through a purchase of shares or assets.

10. **Spin-Off:** A company creates a new, separate company by divesting a portion of its existing business. Shareholders of the parent company often receive shares in the new entity.

11. **Tender Offer:** A company offers to buy back shares from its shareholders at a specified price, often at a premium.

12. **Divestiture:** A company sells off a portion of its business or assets.

13. **Amalgamation:** The merging of two or more companies into a single entity, usually involving the creation of a new company.

14. **Consolidation:** Two or more companies combine to form a new company, often with a new name and stock.

15. **Rights Redemption:** A company buys back the rights it issued in a rights issue before they are exercised.

16. **Name Change:** A company changes its name, often reflecting a change in business focus or strategy.

17. **Delisting:** A company's shares are removed from trading on a stock exchange, usually due to financial distress, merger, or acquisition.

18. **Change in Capital Structure:** Alterations to the company's share capital, such as increasing or decreasing authorized share capital.

These are just a few examples of corporate actions. Each action can have different implications for shareholders and the company's overall financial and operational landscape. It's important for investors to stay informed about corporate actions that could impact their investments.
