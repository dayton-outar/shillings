Now, compare the above model by Damodaran with Simply Wall Street's model (or flowchart),[^2]

> DCF is the most widely-accepted method to calculate the fair value of a company. It is based on the premise that the fair value of a company is the total value of its incoming cash flow less its expenses, technically called Free Cash Flows (FCF), discounted to today&#39;s value.

> The SWS app uses four variations of DCF depending on the characteristics of a particular stock, such as industry and data availability.

> - **2-Stage Discounted Cash Flow Model:** suitable for companies that do not necessarily grow at a constant rate over time. They tend to be high-growth initially, and become stable after a couple of years.
> - **Dividend Discount Model (DDM):** accurate for companies that consistently pays out a meaningful portion of their earnings as dividends.
> - **Excess Returns Model:** used for financial companies such as banks and insurance, generally do not have a significant proportion of physical assets, and face different regulatory requirements for cash holdings.
> - **Adjusted-Funds-From-Operations (AFFO) 2-Stage Discounted Cash Flow Model:** used for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), as they incur capital gains and other real estate-specific factors which impacts their free cash flows.

If the company that issued stocks on a stock market pays dividends, a version of the Discounted Cash Flow Model referred to as the _Dividend-Discount Model_ can be applied to arrive at the net present value of the stock.

The equation below applies to a single N-year investor, who will collect dividends for N years and then sell the stock, or to a series of investors who hold the stock for shorter periods and then resell it.[^3]

$$\huge{P_0 = {Div_1 \over 1 + r_E} + {Div_2 \over (1 + r_E)^2} + {Div_3 \over (1 + r_E)^3} + \ldots + {Div_N \over (1 + r_E)^N} + { P_N \over (1 + r_E)^N } }$$

For the special case in which the firm eventually pays dividends and is never acquired, it is possible to hold the shares forever.

$$\huge{P_0 = {Div_1 \over 1 + r_E} + {Div_2 \over (1 + r_E)^2} + {Div_3 \over (1 + r_E)^3} + \ldots = \sum_{n=1}^\infty {Div_n \over (1 + r_E)^n} }$$

The main ingredients needed to arrive at the value of a company includes,

1. Financial Statements
   
   3 main statements are required: Income-Expense, Balance Sheet and Cashflow Statement

2. Stock Prices

   Used to calculate the risk and return. Helps to deduce _Cost of capital_

3. Stock Indices

   Used to arrive at a &beta; for the risk value of stock or portfolio being evaluated

4. Interest Rates of Jurisdiction

    These rates are described as the risk-free rate; important to calculate _Cost of capital_


$$\huge{Enterprise\text{ }Value\text{ }in\text{ }Year\text{ }T = V_T^L = { FCF_{T + 1} \over r_{wacc} - g } }$$

> we observed that the value of a firm is a function of three variablesâ€”its capacity to generate cash flows, its expected growth in these cash flows, and the uncertainty associated with these cash flows
