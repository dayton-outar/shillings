# Securities Trading Analysis

This body of work is the foundation of an online business that is dedicated to educate the common man about the business of trading securities and to facilitate the ease of trading these securities. The philosophy around the education of securities trading are classified in three categories: Fundamental Analysis, Technical Analysis and Behavioural Economics.

The education provided in this project involves constant updates to the state of each business that are on a stock exchange by breaking down the details of annual and quarterly report through the presentation of all the important multiples (or financial ratios) that can be calculated from each report. Also, provided in the continuous learning experience is the evaluation of the business as an asset. The studying of multiples, business evaluation and the effects of the economy constitutes **Fundamental Analysis**.

Trading is an economic activity based on human behaviour and the perception of the thing being traded. Even though Brent Donnelly wrote _The Art of Currency Trading_ to focus solely on trading of foreign exchange currency, I think that many of the philosophies can be used in stock trading. Donnelly remarks,

> My philosophy is that sustainable long-term success in FX trading is best achived using a fusion approach. This is a hybrid adaptive process that combines _fundamental and macroeconomic analysis, behavioral finance, technical analysis, and diligent risk management_.

Warren Buffet and his mentor, Benjamin Graham, are strong believers in fundamental analysis, especially analysis that unravels the intrinsic value of a company, to determine how to buy stocks for the long-term. Buffett looks for stocks that he believes are undervalued by the market. He seeks companies with strong fundamentals, including a competitive advantage, consistent earnings, and a durable business model.

The stock market, however, is filled with investors that may not embrace those beliefs. Investors are influenced to trade stocks on a number of factors that do not include the fundamental analysis of a company. Investors can be influenced by macro-economic factors such as inflation caused by changes in supply-chain management of goods and services in the world due to geo-political tensions. Investors are social beings and, hence, many will trade stocks based on what the 'herd' decides to do.

Price action of stocks are based on supply and demand. It's basically a democratic process. When stocks are traded, it is basically investors voting with their money on whether they believe the value of a stock is going up or down. Socrates, the Greek Philosopher, expressed concerns about democracy when he criticised the idea of majority rule without a proper emphasis on wisdom and knowledge. He believed that decisions in a democratic society were often driven by the opinions of the majority, irrespective of their level of understanding or expertise on a given issue.

Socrates argued that a democratic system could lead to decisions influenced by emotional appeals and demagogy rather than rational thinking and expertise. He was skeptical about the ability of the general populace to make informed and wise decisions, particularly in complex matters. Socrates believed that individuals with specialized knowledge and expertise, such as philosophers, should have a greater role in decision-making.

So, let's bring the relevance of Socrates philosophy on democracy to Buffet's philosophy. Buffet's philosophy will only work if all investors were operating strictly off the performance of the company to which the stocks are associated.
