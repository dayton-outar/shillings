# Securities Trading Analysis

This body of work is the foundation of an online business that is dedicated to educate the common man about the business of trading securities and to facilitate the ease of trading these securities. The philosophy around the education of securities trading are classified in three categories: Fundamental Analysis, Technical Analysis and Behavioural Economics.

The education provided in this project involves constant updates to the state of each business that are on a stock exchange by breaking down the details of annual and quarterly report through the presentation of all the important multiples (or financial ratios) that can be calculated from each report. Also, provided in the continuous learning experience is the evaluation of the business as an asset. The studying of multiples, business evaluation and the effects of the economy constitutes **Fundamental Analysis**.

Trading is an economic activity based on human behaviour and the perception of the thing being traded. Even though Brent Donnelly wrote _The Art of Currency Trading_ to focus solely on trading of foreign exchange currency, I think that many of the philosophies can be used in stock trading. Donnelly remarks,

> My philosophy is that sustainable long-term success in FX trading is best achived using a fusion approach. This is a hybrid adaptive process that combines _fundamental and macroeconomic analysis, behavioral finance, technical analysis, and diligent risk management_.

> **Fundamental analysis** is the study of macroeconomic factors that drive markets (as opposed to other factors like momentum, positioning, and psychology ...).[^1]

> **Technical analysis** is the study of chart patterns in an attempt to forecast future price movements.[^2]
