# Asset Evaluation

An _asset_ is any entity that delivers cashflow and/or appreciates in value over time.

> Valuation matters in the super-long-term, for example, while positioning and momentum matter much more in the short-term.[^1]

![Valuation Models](/.attachments/valuation-models.png)

There are 4 main approaches to valuation,

1. **Contingency Claim Model**: Developed by Aswath Damodaran, the Contingency Claim Model is a framework for valuing companies based on the value of their equity and debt claims. It incorporates option pricing theory and considers the company's equity as a call option on the value of its assets. This model is particularly relevant for valuing companies with complex capital structures or those facing financial distress.

2. **Relative Valuation**: This method involves comparing the valuation metrics (such as price-to-earnings ratio, price-to-book ratio, or enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio) of the company with those of similar companies or industry averages. Relative valuation is useful for assessing how a company's valuation multiples compare to its peers and can provide insights into whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its industry.

3. **Asset-based Valuation**: Asset-based valuation involves estimating the value of a company based on the value of its assets minus its liabilities. This method is particularly useful for companies with significant tangible assets, such as manufacturing or real estate companies. Asset-based valuation may include valuing assets at their book value, fair market value, or replacement cost.

4. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**: DCF analysis involves estimating the present value of a company's future cash flows. It requires forecasting the company's future cash flows, determining an appropriate discount rate (usually the company's cost of capital or weighted average cost of capital), and discounting the future cash flows back to their present value. DCF analysis is considered one of the most fundamental and theoretically sound methods of valuation.

Each of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on factors such as the company's industry, stage of development, financial condition, and the availability of data. Often, multiple valuation methods are used in conjunction to triangulate a fair value estimate for a company.

## Contingency Claim Model

The Contingency Claim Model, developed by Aswath Damodaran, is particularly appropriate for evaluating businesses with complex capital structures or those facing financial distress. Let's break down the key features of the model and discuss scenarios in which it is suitable:

1. **Incorporates Option Pricing Theory**: The Contingency Claim Model is grounded in option pricing theory, which treats a company's equity as a call option on the value of its assets. This means that equity holders benefit when the value of the company's assets exceeds its liabilities, similar to how call option holders benefit when the underlying asset's price exceeds the strike price.

2. **Accounts for Financial Distress**: The model is especially useful for companies facing financial distress or uncertainty about their future viability. In such scenarios, the company's equity behaves like a call option with a high degree of uncertainty and volatility, as there is a possibility of the company defaulting on its obligations or undergoing bankruptcy proceedings.

3. **Analyzes Equity and Debt Claims**: The Contingency Claim Model evaluates the value of both equity and debt claims on a company's assets. By considering the rights and priorities of different stakeholders in the capital structure, the model provides insights into the potential distribution of value among shareholders and creditors under different scenarios.

4. **Suitable for Leveraged Companies**: Companies with high levels of debt or complex capital structures, such as those with multiple layers of debt or hybrid securities, can benefit from the Contingency Claim Model. The model helps assess the impact of leverage on the value of equity and debt claims and allows stakeholders to make informed decisions about capital structure optimization and risk management.

5. **Useful for Valuing Distressed Companies**: When valuing distressed companies or companies operating in volatile industries, traditional valuation methods may not accurately capture the value of equity due to the high degree of uncertainty and risk. The Contingency Claim Model provides a framework for incorporating this uncertainty into the valuation process and can help stakeholders make more informed decisions in such challenging circumstances.

In summary, the Contingency Claim Model is appropriate for evaluating businesses with complex capital structures, facing financial distress, or operating in volatile industries where traditional valuation methods may not adequately capture the value of equity. It provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing equity and debt claims and assessing the impact of uncertainty and leverage on the company's value.

Black-Scholes and option pricing theory can be had from John C. Hull's book, _Options, Futures and Other Derivatives_.

## Relative Valuation Model

Damodaran explains relative valuation in Chapters 17 to 20 in _Investment Valution: Tools and Techniques for Determining the Value of Any Asset_.

## Asset-based Valuation

Damodaran does not go into much detail explaining _asset-based valuation_ only to state[^4],

> There are some analysts who add a fourth approach to valuation to the three described in this chapter. They argue that you can value the individual assets owned by a firm and aggregate them to arrive at a firm value—asset-based valuation models. In fact, there are several variants on asset-based valuation models. The first is liquidation value, which is obtained by aggregating the estimated sale proceeds of the assets owned by a firm. The second is **replacement cost**, where you estimate what it would cost you to replace all of the assets that a firm has today. The third is the simplest: use accounting book value as the measure of the value of the assets, with adjustments to the book value made where necessary.
> 
> While analysts may use asset-based valuation approaches to estimate value, they are not alternatives to discounted cash flow, relative, or option pricing models since both replacement and liquidation values have to be obtained using one or another of these approaches. Ultimately, all valuation models attempt to value assets; the differences arise in how we identify the assets and how we attach value to each asset. In liquidation valuation, we look only at assets in place and estimate their value based on what similar assets are priced at in the market. In traditional discounted cash flow valuation, we consider all assets and include expected growth potential to arrive at value. The two approaches may, in fact, yield the same values if you have a firm that has no growth potential and the market assessments of value reflect expected cash flows.

He gives an example[^5],

> In asset-based valuation, we value the existing assets of a financial service firm, net out debt and other outstanding claims, and report the difference as the value of equity. For example, with a bank, this would require valuing the loan portfolio of the bank (which would comprise its assets) and subtracting outstanding debt to estimate the value of equity. For an insurance company, you would value the policies that the company has in force and subtract out the expected claims resulting from these policies and other debt outstanding to estimate the value of the equity in the firm.
> 
> How would you value the loan portfolio of a bank or the policies of an insurance company? One approach would be to estimate the price at which the loan portfolio can be sold to another financial service firm, but the better approach is to value it based on the expected cash flows. Consider, for instance, a bank with a $1 billion loan portfolio with a weighted average maturity of eight years, on which it earns interest income of $70 million. Furthermore, assume that the default risk on the loans is such that the fair market interest rate on the loans would be 6.50 percent; this fair market rate can be estimated by either getting the loan portfolio rated by a ratings agency or by measuring the potential for default risk in the portfolio. The value of the loans can be estimated as follows:
> 
> $\text{$Value of loans} = $70 million (\text{PV of annuity}, 8 years, 6.5\%) + $1,000 million \over 1.065^8 = $1,030 million$
> 
> This loan portfolio has a fair market value that exceeds its book value because the bank is charging an interest rate that exceeds the market rate. The reverse would be true if the bank charged an interest rate that is lower than the market rate. To value the equity in this book, you would subtract out the deposits, debt, and other claims on the bank.
> 
> This approach has merit if you are valuing a mature bank or insurance company with little or no growth potential, but it has two significant limitations. First, it does not assign any value to expected future growth and the excess returns that flow from that growth. A bank, for instance, that consistently is able to lend at rates higher than justified by default risk should be able to harvest value from future loans as well. Second, it is difficult to apply when a financial service firm enters multiple businesses. A firm like Citigroup that operates in multiple businesses would prove to be difficult to value because the assets in each business—insurance, commercial banking, investment banking, portfolio management—would need to be valued separately, with different income streams and different discount rates.

### Liquidation Value

> In some valuations, we can assume that the firm will cease operations at a point in time in the future and sell the assets it has accumulated to the highest bidders. The estimate that emerges is called a liquidation value. There are two ways in which the liquidation value can be estimated. One is to base it on the book value of the assets, adjusted for any inflation during the period. Thus, if the book value of assets 10 years from now is expected to be $2 billion, the average age of the assets at that point is five years and the expected inflation rate is 3 percent, the expected liquidation value can be estimated as:
> 
> The limitation of this approach is that it is based on accounting book value and does not reflect the earning power of the assets.
> 
> $\text{Expected liquidation value} = \text{Book value of assets}_{term year}(1 + \text{Inflation rate})^{average life of assets}$
> $= $2 billion(1.03)^5 = $2.319 billion$
>
> The alternative approach is to estimate the value based on the earning power of the assets. To make this estimate, we would first have to estimate the expected cash flows from the assets and then discount these cash flows back to the present, using an appropriate discount rate. In the preceding example, for instance, if we assumed that the assets in question could be expected to generate $400 million in after-tax cash flows for 15 years (after the terminal year) and the cost of capital was 10 percent, our estimate of the expected liquidation value would be:
> 
> $\text{Expected liquidation value} = $400 million(PV of annuity, 15 years @ 10\%)$
> $= $3.042 billion$
>
> When valuing equity, there is one additional step that needs to be taken. The estimated value of debt outstanding in the terminal year has to be subtracted from the liquidation value to arrive at the liquidation proceeds for equity investors.[^6]

## Discounted Cashflow Model

See below the model used by Damodaran to identify the type of Cashflow model to use to evaluate an asset,

![Discounted Cashflow Model](/.attachments/discounted-cashflow-model.png)

Now, compare the above model by Damodaran with Simply Wall Street's model (or flowchart),[^2]

> DCF is the most widely-accepted method to calculate the fair value of a company. It is based on the premise that the fair value of a company is the total value of its incoming cash flow less its expenses, technically called Free Cash Flows (FCF), discounted to today&#39;s value.
>
> The SWS app uses four variations of DCF depending on the characteristics of a particular stock, such as industry and data availability.
> 
> - **2-Stage Discounted Cash Flow Model:** suitable for companies that do not necessarily grow at a constant rate over time. They tend to be high-growth initially, and become stable after a couple of years.
> - **Dividend Discount Model (DDM):** accurate for companies that consistently pays out a meaningful portion of their earnings as dividends.
> - **Excess Returns Model:** used for financial companies such as banks and insurance, generally do not have a significant proportion of physical assets, and face different regulatory requirements for cash holdings.
> - **Adjusted-Funds-From-Operations (AFFO) 2-Stage Discounted Cash Flow Model:** used for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), as they incur capital gains and other real estate-specific factors which impacts their free cash flows.
>

The value of any asset following the present value rule is, 

$$\huge{Value = \sum_{t=1}^{t=n}{CF_{t} \over (1 + r)^t}}$$

where,

<blockquote>
<p>n = Life of the asset</p>
<p>CF<sub>t</sub> = Cash flow in period t</p>
<p>r = Discount rate reflecting the riskiness of the estimated cash flows</p>
</blockquote>

Cash flow can be determined from 2 main sources for stocks: dividends and free cash flow. Some of the mathematical approaches to evaluation of a stock includes,

1. Dividend-Discount Model
2. Free Cash Flow to Equity Model
3. Free Cash Flow to Firm Model

If the company that issued stocks on a stock market pays dividends, a version of the Discounted Cash Flow Model referred to as the _Dividend-Discount Model_ can be applied to arrive at the net present value of the stock.

The equation below applies to a single N-year investor, who will collect dividends for N years and then sell the stock, or to a series of investors who hold the stock for shorter periods and then resell it.[^3]

$$\huge{P_0 = {Div_1 \over 1 + r_E} + {Div_2 \over (1 + r_E)^2} + {Div_3 \over (1 + r_E)^3} + \ldots + {Div_N \over (1 + r_E)^N} + { P_N \over (1 + r_E)^N } }$$

For the special case in which the firm eventually pays dividends and is never acquired, it is possible to hold the shares forever.

$$\huge{P_0 = {Div_1 \over 1 + r_E} + {Div_2 \over (1 + r_E)^2} + {Div_3 \over (1 + r_E)^3} + \ldots = \sum_{n=1}^\infty {Div_n \over (1 + r_E)^n} }$$

The main ingredients needed to arrive at the value of a company includes,

1. Financial Statements
   
   3 main statements are required: Income-Expense, Balance Sheet and Cashflow Statement

2. Stock Prices

   Used to calculate the risk and return. Helps to deduce _Cost of capital_

3. Stock Indices

   Used to arrive at a &beta; for the risk value of stock or portfolio being evaluated

4. Interest Rates of Jurisdiction

    These rates are described as the risk-free rate; important to calculate _Cost of capital_


$$\huge{Enterprise\text{ }Value\text{ }in\text{ }Year\text{ }T = V_T^L = { FCF_{T + 1} \over r_{wacc} - g } }$$

> we observed that the value of a firm is a function of three variables—its capacity to generate cash flows, its expected growth in these cash flows, and the uncertainty associated with these cash flows
