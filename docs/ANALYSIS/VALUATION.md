# Asset Evaluation

An _asset_ is any entity that delivers cashflow and/or appreciates in value over time.

> Valuation matters in the super-long-term, for example, while positioning and momentum matter much more in the short-term.[^1]

![Valuation Models](/.attachments/valuation-models.png)

There are 4 main approaches to valuation,

1. **Asset-based Valuation**: Asset-based valuation involves estimating the value of a company based on the value of its assets minus its liabilities. This method is particularly useful for companies with significant tangible assets, such as manufacturing or real estate companies. Asset-based valuation may include valuing assets at their book value, fair market value, or replacement cost.

2. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**: DCF analysis involves estimating the present value of a company's future cash flows. It requires forecasting the company's future cash flows, determining an appropriate discount rate (usually the company's cost of capital or weighted average cost of capital), and discounting the future cash flows back to their present value. DCF analysis is considered one of the most fundamental and theoretically sound methods of valuation.

3. **Relative Valuation**: This method involves comparing the valuation metrics (such as price-to-earnings ratio, price-to-book ratio, or enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio) of the company with those of similar companies or industry averages. Relative valuation is useful for assessing how a company's valuation multiples compare to its peers and can provide insights into whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its industry.

4. **Contingency Claim Model**: Developed by Aswath Damodaran, the Contingency Claim Model is a framework for valuing companies based on the value of their equity and debt claims. It incorporates option pricing theory and considers the company's equity as a call option on the value of its assets. This model is particularly relevant for valuing companies with complex capital structures or those facing financial distress.

Each of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on factors such as the company's industry, stage of development, financial condition, and the availability of data. Often, multiple valuation methods are used in conjunction to triangulate a fair value estimate for a company.

## Asset-based Valuation

_Asset-based valuation_ is a model of evalaution that is best used when a business is in distress. Some analyst may prefer the simpler and more straithforward approach than _Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis_. In _asset-intensive_ industries, like manufacturing, real estate, or natural resources, the value of assets on the balance sheet can be a more reliable indicator of value than future cash flows.

Damodaran does not go into much detail explaining _asset-based valuation_ only to state[^4],

> There are some analysts who add a fourth approach to valuation to the three described in this chapter. They argue that you can value the individual assets owned by a firm and aggregate them to arrive at a firm value—asset-based valuation models. In fact, there are several variants on asset-based valuation models. The first is **liquidation value**, which is obtained by aggregating the estimated sale proceeds of the assets owned by a firm. The second is **replacement cost**, where you estimate what it would cost you to replace all of the assets that a firm has today. The third is the simplest: use **accounting book value** as the measure of the value of the assets, with adjustments to the book value made where necessary.
> 
> While analysts may use asset-based valuation approaches to estimate value, they are not alternatives to discounted cash flow, relative, or option pricing models since both replacement and liquidation values have to be obtained using one or another of these approaches. Ultimately, all valuation models attempt to value assets; the differences arise in how we identify the assets and how we attach value to each asset. In liquidation valuation, we look only at assets in place and estimate their value based on what similar assets are priced at in the market. In traditional discounted cash flow valuation, we consider all assets and include expected growth potential to arrive at value. The two approaches may, in fact, yield the same values if you have a firm that has no growth potential and the market assessments of value reflect expected cash flows.

He gives an example[^5],

> In asset-based valuation, we value the existing assets of a financial service firm, net out debt and other outstanding claims, and report the difference as the value of equity. For example, with a bank, this would require valuing the loan portfolio of the bank (which would comprise its assets) and subtracting outstanding debt to estimate the value of equity. For an insurance company, you would value the policies that the company has in force and subtract out the expected claims resulting from these policies and other debt outstanding to estimate the value of the equity in the firm.
> 
> How would you value the loan portfolio of a bank or the policies of an insurance company? One approach would be to estimate the price at which the loan portfolio can be sold to another financial service firm, but the better approach is to value it based on the expected cash flows. Consider, for instance, a bank with a $1 billion loan portfolio with a weighted average maturity of eight years, on which it earns interest income of $70 million. Furthermore, assume that the default risk on the loans is such that the fair market interest rate on the loans would be 6.50 percent; this fair market rate can be estimated by either getting the loan portfolio rated by a ratings agency or by measuring the potential for default risk in the portfolio. The value of the loans can be estimated as follows:
> 
$$\text{Value of loans} = $70 million \text{(PV of annuity, 8 years, 6.5 percent)} + {$1,000 million \over 1.065^8} = $1,030 million$$
> 
> This loan portfolio has a fair market value that exceeds its book value because the bank is charging an interest rate that exceeds the market rate. The reverse would be true if the bank charged an interest rate that is lower than the market rate. To value the equity in this book, you would subtract out the deposits, debt, and other claims on the bank.
> 
> This approach has merit if you are valuing a mature bank or insurance company with little or no growth potential, but it has two significant limitations. First, it does not assign any value to expected future growth and the excess returns that flow from that growth. A bank, for instance, that consistently is able to lend at rates higher than justified by default risk should be able to harvest value from future loans as well. Second, it is difficult to apply when a financial service firm enters multiple businesses. A firm like Citigroup that operates in multiple businesses would prove to be difficult to value because the assets in each business—insurance, commercial banking, investment banking, portfolio management—would need to be valued separately, with different income streams and different discount rates.

### Liquidation Value

> In some valuations, we can assume that the firm will cease operations at a point in time in the future and sell the assets it has accumulated to the highest bidders. The estimate that emerges is called a liquidation value. There are two ways in which the liquidation value can be estimated. One is to base it on the book value of the assets, adjusted for any inflation during the period. Thus, if the book value of assets 10 years from now is expected to be $2 billion, the average age of the assets at that point is five years and the expected inflation rate is 3 percent, the expected liquidation value can be estimated as:
> 
> The limitation of this approach is that it is based on accounting book value and does not reflect the earning power of the assets.
> 
$$\text{Expected liquidation value} = \text{Book value of assets}_\text{term year}(1 + \text{Inflation rate})^\text{average life of assets} = $2 billion(1.03)^5 = $2.319 billion$$
>
> The alternative approach is to estimate the value based on the earning power of the assets. To make this estimate, we would first have to estimate the expected cash flows from the assets and then discount these cash flows back to the present, using an appropriate discount rate. In the preceding example, for instance, if we assumed that the assets in question could be expected to generate $400 million in after-tax cash flows for 15 years (after the terminal year) and the cost of capital was 10 percent, our estimate of the expected liquidation value would be:
> 
$$\text{Expected liquidation value} = $400 million(\text{PV of annuity, 15 years @ 10 percent}) = $3.042 billion$$
>
> When valuing equity, there is one additional step that needs to be taken. The estimated value of debt outstanding in the terminal year has to be subtracted from the liquidation value to arrive at the liquidation proceeds for equity investors.[^6]

### Replacement Cost

To perform asset-based valuation to arrive at replacement cost, you typically follow these steps:

1. **Identify Assets**: List all tangible and intangible assets owned by the company, including property, equipment, inventory, patents, trademarks, etc.

2. **Determine Replacement Cost**: Estimate the cost of replacing each asset at current market prices. For tangible assets, this involves obtaining quotes from suppliers or contractors. For intangible assets, you may need to estimate the cost of developing or acquiring similar assets.

3. **Adjust for Depreciation**: Consider the depreciation of existing assets. Tangible assets may have depreciated in value over time due to wear and tear, while intangible assets may have lost value due to obsolescence or expiration.

4. **Summarize Values**: Total the replacement costs of all assets after adjusting for depreciation. This total represents the asset-based valuation.

5. **Consider Liabilities**: Take into account any outstanding liabilities or debts associated with the assets, as these reduce the net value of the assets.

6. **Compare to Market Value**: Evaluate how the asset-based valuation compares to the market value of the company. If the asset-based valuation significantly exceeds the market value, it may indicate undervaluation in the market.

7. **Assess Other Factors**: Consider other factors such as the company's growth potential, market conditions, and industry trends, which may impact the overall valuation.

Determining current market prices of an asset involves various methods depending on the type of asset and market conditions. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Comparable Sales Approach**: This method is commonly used for real estate and involves analyzing recent sales prices of similar properties in the same or similar location. By comparing the features and characteristics of the assets, you can estimate the market value of the subject asset.

2. **Market Indexes**: For assets traded in financial markets such as stocks, bonds, or commodities, market indexes provide a benchmark for current prices. These indexes track the performance of a specific market or sector, allowing investors to gauge the current market value of assets within that category.

3. **Auction Markets**: In auction markets, such as those for art, collectibles, or certain types of commodities, recent auction results can provide insights into current market prices. Prices realized at auctions reflect the willingness of buyers to pay for the assets at a given point in time.

4. **Online Platforms and Marketplaces**: For certain types of assets, online platforms and marketplaces provide real-time pricing information. This includes e-commerce websites for retail goods, online trading platforms for stocks and cryptocurrencies, and platforms for buying and selling used goods.

5. **Appraisal Services**: Professional appraisers can provide valuation services for a wide range of assets, including real estate, machinery, equipment, and collectibles. These appraisals consider various factors such as asset condition, demand, and market trends to determine current market prices.

6. **Industry Reports and Publications**: Industry-specific reports, publications, and databases often provide information on market prices for particular assets. These resources may include data on recent transactions, pricing trends, and supply-demand dynamics within the industry.

7. **Broker or Dealer Quotations**: For assets traded in financial markets, brokers or dealers can provide real-time quotations indicating the current market price at which they are willing to buy or sell the asset.

8. **Expert Opinion**: In some cases, experts in a particular field or industry may provide insights into current market prices based on their knowledge and experience.

When determining current market prices, it's important to consider the reliability and accuracy of the data sources used, as well as any specific factors or conditions that may impact the valuation of the asset.

## Discounted Cashflow Model

See below the model used by Damodaran to identify the type of Cashflow model to use to evaluate an asset,

![Discounted Cashflow Model](/.attachments/discounted-cashflow-model.png)

Now, compare the above model by Damodaran with Simply Wall Street's model (or flowchart),[^2]

> DCF is the most widely-accepted method to calculate the fair value of a company. It is based on the premise that the fair value of a company is the total value of its incoming cash flow less its expenses, technically called Free Cash Flows (FCF), discounted to today&#39;s value.
>
> The SWS app uses four variations of DCF depending on the characteristics of a particular stock, such as industry and data availability.
> 
> - **2-Stage Discounted Cash Flow Model:** suitable for companies that do not necessarily grow at a constant rate over time. They tend to be high-growth initially, and become stable after a couple of years.
> - **Dividend Discount Model (DDM):** accurate for companies that consistently pays out a meaningful portion of their earnings as dividends.
> - **Excess Returns Model:** used for financial companies such as banks and insurance, generally do not have a significant proportion of physical assets, and face different regulatory requirements for cash holdings.
> - **Adjusted-Funds-From-Operations (AFFO) 2-Stage Discounted Cash Flow Model:** used for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), as they incur capital gains and other real estate-specific factors which impacts their free cash flows.
>

The value of any asset following the present value rule is, 

$$\huge{Value = \sum_{t=1}^{t=n}{CF_{t} \over (1 + r)^t}}$$

where,

<blockquote>
<p>n = Life of the asset</p>
<p>CF<sub>t</sub> = Cash flow in period t</p>
<p>r = Discount rate reflecting the riskiness of the estimated cash flows</p>
</blockquote>

Cash flow can be determined from 2 main sources for stocks: dividends and free cash flow. Some of the mathematical approaches to evaluation of a stock includes,

1. Dividend-Discount Model
2. Free Cash Flow to Equity Model
3. Free Cash Flow to Firm Model

If the company that issued stocks on a stock market pays dividends, a version of the Discounted Cash Flow Model referred to as the _Dividend-Discount Model_ can be applied to arrive at the net present value of the stock.

The equation below applies to a single N-year investor, who will collect dividends for N years and then sell the stock, or to a series of investors who hold the stock for shorter periods and then resell it.[^3]

$$\huge{P_0 = {Div_1 \over 1 + r_E} + {Div_2 \over (1 + r_E)^2} + {Div_3 \over (1 + r_E)^3} + \ldots + {Div_N \over (1 + r_E)^N} + { P_N \over (1 + r_E)^N } }$$

For the special case in which the firm eventually pays dividends and is never acquired, it is possible to hold the shares forever.

$$\huge{P_0 = {Div_1 \over 1 + r_E} + {Div_2 \over (1 + r_E)^2} + {Div_3 \over (1 + r_E)^3} + \ldots = \sum_{n=1}^\infty {Div_n \over (1 + r_E)^n} }$$

The main ingredients needed to arrive at the value of a company includes,

1. Financial Statements
   
   3 main statements are required: Income-Expense, Balance Sheet and Cashflow Statement

2. Stock Prices

   Used to calculate the risk and return. Helps to deduce _Cost of capital_

3. Stock Indices

   Used to arrive at a &beta; for the risk value of stock or portfolio being evaluated

4. Interest Rates of Jurisdiction

    These rates are described as the risk-free rate; important to calculate _Cost of capital_


$$\huge{Enterprise\text{ }Value\text{ }in\text{ }Year\text{ }T = V_T^L = { FCF_{T + 1} \over r_{wacc} - g } }$$

> we observed that the value of a firm is a function of three variables—its capacity to generate cash flows, its expected growth in these cash flows, and the uncertainty associated with these cash flows

## Relative Valuation Model

> In relative valuation, the objective is to value assets based on how similar assets are currently priced in the market. ...
> 
> ...
> 
> There are two components to relative valuation. The first is that, to value assets on a relative basis, prices have to be standardized, usually by converting prices into multiples of earnings, book values, or sales. The second is to find similar firms, which is difficult to do since _no two firms are identical and firms in the same business can still differ on risk, growth potential, and cash flows_.
> 
> ...
> 
> There are several reasons why relative valuation is so widely used. First, a valuation based on a multiple and comparable firms _can be completed with far fewer explicit assumptions and far more quickly than a discounted cash flow valuation_. Second, a relative valuation is _simpler to understand and easier to present to clients and customers than a discounted cash flow valuation_. Put differently, it is far easier to frame an asset as cheap or expensive using a multiple rather than a discounted cash flow valuation. Finally, a relative valuation is much more likely to reflect the current mood of the market, since it is an attempt to measure relative and not intrinsic value.
> 
> ...
> 
> The strengths of relative valuation are also its weaknesses. First, the ease with which a relative valuation can be put together, pulling together a multiple and a group of comparable firms, can also result in inconsistent estimates of value where key variables such as risk, growth, or cash flow potential are ignored. Second, the fact that multiples reflect the market mood also implies that using relative valuation to estimate the value of an asset can result in values that are too high when the market is overvaluing comparable firms, or too low when it is undervaluing these firms. Third, while there is scope for bias in any type of valuation, the lack of transparency regarding the underlying assumptions in relative valuations makes them particularly vulnerable to manipulation. A biased analyst who is allowed to choose the multiple on which the valuation is based and to pick the comparable firms can essentially ensure that almost any value can be justified.
> 
> ...
> 
> The price of a stock is a function of both the value of the equity in a company and the number of shares outstanding in the firm. Thus, a 2-for-1 stock split that doubles the number of units will approximately halve the stock price. Since stock prices are determined by the number of units of equity in a firm, stock prices cannot be compared across different firms. To compare the values of similar firms in the market, you need to standardize the values in some way. Values for businesses can be standardized relative to the earnings generated, to the book value or replacement value of the assets employed, to the revenues generated, or to measures that are specific to firms in a sector.
> 
> ...
> 
> When buying a business, as opposed to just the equity in the business, it is common to examine the value of the operating assets of the firm (also called enterprise value) as a multiple of the operating income or the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). While, for a buyer of the equity or the operating assets, a lower multiple is better than a higher one, these multiples will be affected by the growth potential and risk of the business being acquired.
> 
> ...
> 
> Even the simplest multiples can be defined differently by different analysts. Consider, for instance, the price-earnings (PE) ratio. Most analysts define it to be the market price divided by the earnings per share, but that is where the consensus ends. There are a number of variants on the PE ratio. While the current price is conventionally used in the numerator, there are some analysts who use the average price over the prior six months or year. The earnings per share in the denominator can be the earnings per share from the most recent financial year (yielding the current PE), the last four quarters of earnings (yielding the trailing PE), or expected earnings per share in the next financial year (resulting in a forward PE). In addition, earnings per share can be computed based on primary shares outstanding or fully diluted shares, and can include or exclude extraordinary items. ... 
> 
> Not only can these variants on earnings yield vastly different values for the price-earnings ratio, but the one that gets used by analysts depends on their biases. For instance, in periods of rising earnings, the forward PE yields consistently lower values than the trailing PE, which, in turn, is lower than the current PE. A bullish analyst will tend to use the forward PE to make the case that the stock is trading at a low multiple of earnings, while a bearish analyst will focus on the current PE to make the case that the multiple is too high. The first step when discussing a valuation based on a multiple is to ensure that everyone in the discussion is using the same definition for that multiple.
> 
> **Consistency** Every multiple has a numerator and a denominator. The numerator can be either an equity value (such as market price or value of equity) or a firm value (such as enterprise value, which is the sum of the values of debt and equity, net of cash). The denominator can be an equity measure (such as earnings per share, net income, or book value of equity) or a firm measure (such as operating income, EBITDA, or book value of capital).
> 
> One of the key tests to run on a multiple is to examine whether the numerator and denominator are defined consistently. _If the numerator for a multiple is an equity value, then the denominator should be an equity value as well. If the numerator is a firm value, then the denominator should be a firm value as well._ To illustrate, the price-earnings ratio is a consistently defined multiple, since the numerator is the price per share (which is an equity value) and the denominator is earnings per share (which is also an equity value). So is the enterprise value to EBITDA multiple, since the numerator and denominator are both firm value measures.
> 
> Are there any multiples in use that are inconsistently defined? Consider the Price-to-EBITDA multiple, a multiple that acquired a few adherents in the past few years. The numerator in this multiple is an equity value, and the denominator is a measure of earnings to the firm. The analysts who use this multiple will probably argue that the inconsistency does not matter since the multiple is computed the same way for all of the comparable firms; but they would be wrong. If some firms on the list have no debt and others carry significant amounts of debt, the latter will look cheap on a Price-to-EBITDA basis, when in fact they might be overpriced or correctly priced.
> 
> **Uniformity** In relative valuation, the multiple is computed for all of the firms in a group and then compared across these firms to make judgments on which firms are overpriced and which are underpriced. For this comparison to have any merit, the multiple has to be defined uniformly across all of the firms in the group. Thus, if the trailing PE is used for one firm, it has to be used for all of the others as well. In fact, one of the problems with using the current PE to compare firms in a group is that different firms can have different fiscal year-ends. This can lead to some firms having their prices divided by earnings from July to June, with other firms having their prices divided by earnings from January to December. While the differences can be minor in mature sectors, where earnings do not make quantum jumps over six months, they can be large in high-growth sectors.
> 
> With both earnings and book value measures, there is another component to be concerned about, and that is the accounting standards used to estimate earnings and book values. Differences in accounting standards can result in very different earnings and book value numbers for similar firms. This makes comparisons of multiples across firms in different markets, with different accounting standards, very difficult. ***Even with the same accounting standards, the fact that some firms use different accounting rules (on depreciation and expensing) for reporting purposes and tax purposes and others do not can throw off comparisons of earnings multiples.***[^8]

Take note that Damodaran is elaborating the importance of coparing apples to apples.

> When using a multiple, it is always useful to have a sense of what a high value, a low value, or a typical value for that multiple is in the market. In other words, knowing the distributional characteristics of a multiple is a key part of using that multiple to identify under- or overvalued firms. In addition, you need to understand the effects of outliers on averages and unearth any biases in these values introduced in the process of estimating multiples.[^8]

## Contingency Claim Model

The Contingency Claim Model, developed by Aswath Damodaran, is particularly appropriate for evaluating businesses with complex capital structures or those facing financial distress. Let's break down the key features of the model and discuss scenarios in which it is suitable:

1. **Incorporates Option Pricing Theory**: The Contingency Claim Model is grounded in option pricing theory, which treats a company's equity as a call option on the value of its assets. This means that equity holders benefit when the value of the company's assets exceeds its liabilities, similar to how call option holders benefit when the underlying asset's price exceeds the strike price.

2. **Accounts for Financial Distress**: The model is especially useful for companies facing financial distress or uncertainty about their future viability. In such scenarios, the company's equity behaves like a call option with a high degree of uncertainty and volatility, as there is a possibility of the company defaulting on its obligations or undergoing bankruptcy proceedings.

3. **Analyzes Equity and Debt Claims**: The Contingency Claim Model evaluates the value of both equity and debt claims on a company's assets. By considering the rights and priorities of different stakeholders in the capital structure, the model provides insights into the potential distribution of value among shareholders and creditors under different scenarios.

4. **Suitable for Leveraged Companies**: Companies with high levels of debt or complex capital structures, such as those with multiple layers of debt or hybrid securities, can benefit from the Contingency Claim Model. The model helps assess the impact of leverage on the value of equity and debt claims and allows stakeholders to make informed decisions about capital structure optimization and risk management.

5. **Useful for Valuing Distressed Companies**: When valuing distressed companies or companies operating in volatile industries, traditional valuation methods may not accurately capture the value of equity due to the high degree of uncertainty and risk. The Contingency Claim Model provides a framework for incorporating this uncertainty into the valuation process and can help stakeholders make more informed decisions in such challenging circumstances.

In summary, the Contingency Claim Model is appropriate for evaluating businesses with complex capital structures, facing financial distress, or operating in volatile industries where traditional valuation methods may not adequately capture the value of equity. It provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing equity and debt claims and assessing the impact of uncertainty and leverage on the company's value.

Black-Scholes and option pricing theory can be had from John C. Hull's book, _Options, Futures and Other Derivatives_.
