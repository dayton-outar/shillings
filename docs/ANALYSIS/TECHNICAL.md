# Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is a method used by traders and investors to evaluate and predict future price movements in financial markets. It involves the use of various tools and indicators to make informed decisions. Here's a list of some common tools and indicators used in technical analysis:

1. **Candlestick Charts**: Candlestick charts display price movements over a specified time period, providing information on open, high, low, and close prices.

2. **Moving Averages (MAs)**: These include Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) that help smooth out price data over a specified period, revealing trends.

3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: RSI measures the speed and change of price movements, helping identify overbought or oversold conditions.

4. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages.

5. **Bollinger Bands**: Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band (SMA) and upper and lower bands that help identify volatility and potential reversal points.

6. **Stochastic Oscillator**: It compares the current price to its price range over a specified period, identifying overbought or oversold conditions.

7. **Fibonacci Retracement**: Based on the Fibonacci sequence, this tool is used to identify potential support and resistance levels.

8. **Ichimoku Cloud**: This indicator offers information about support and resistance levels, as well as the overall market trend.

9. **Volume Analysis**: Volume indicators like On-Balance Volume (OBV) can help confirm trends by analyzing trading volumes.

10. **Chart Patterns**: These include common patterns like head and shoulders, double tops and bottoms, flags, and triangles that can signal potential price movements.

11. **Support and Resistance Levels**: Identifying key price levels where assets tend to find support or resistance.

12. **Parabolic SAR**: The Parabolic Stop and Reverse indicator helps traders identify potential entry and exit points.

13. **Average True Range (ATR)**: ATR measures market volatility by calculating the average range between the daily high and low.

14. **Elliott Wave Theory**: A more complex method that seeks to identify patterns in price movements based on a wave theory.

15. **Pivot Points**: These levels indicate potential support and resistance levels based on the previous day's price action.

16. **Williams %R**: This oscillator helps identify overbought or oversold conditions and potential reversals.

17. **Market Sentiment Indicators**: These can include the put-call ratio and the VIX (Volatility Index) to gauge market sentiment.

18. **Candlestick Patterns**: Specific candlestick formations like doji, hammers, and shooting stars can provide insights into market sentiment.

19. **Gaps**: Price gaps on charts can indicate significant price movements and potential areas of support or resistance.

20. **Hull Moving Average**: A more responsive moving average that aims to reduce lag.

These are just some of the many tools and indicators used in technical analysis. Traders often combine multiple indicators to make more informed trading decisions. Keep in mind that technical analysis is not a guaranteed method for predicting market movements, and it's important to use it in conjunction with other forms of analysis and risk management.

### Chapter 6. Understand Technical Analysis I

> While it is hard to assess the forecasting value of technical analysis, there is another simple reason that using technical analysis is inherently risky (assuming you are a human being). Humans are designed to see patterns. It’s how our biology works. It allows us to simplify and process a complex world. _It is called apophenia: the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns within random data._
> 
> ...
> 
> I strongly advise you to learn about technical analysis and use it as a tool—but consider it a risk management and tactical tool, not a trade selection or forecasting tool.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Occam’s Razor states that among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Other, more complicated solutions may ultimately prove correct, but—in the absence of certainty—the fewer assumptions that are made, the better._
> 
> When using technical analysis as a risk management and tactical tool, simpler is always better.
> 
> ...
> 
> My trading strategy is short-term so I use 20-period, 55-period, 100-period, and 200-period moving averages on 10-minute and 1-hour charts. I prefer the 55-hour and 200-hour moving averages as fast and slow indicators for my trading but whether you use 55-hour or 100-hour or 200-hour, the idea and results will be about the same.

> First, the basics of candlestick construction. The difference between the open and the close is called the body of the candlestick. That is the fat part that is black and white (some systems use green and red in place of black and white). The tails outside the body are called the shadow of the candlestick and represent the full range that traded outside of the OPEN/CLOSE range.
> 
> When the candle is green or white, it means the currency pair went up on the day and if it is red or black the currency pair went down. So, to recap, the body is the open to close range, the color defines if the currency pair rose or fell, and the shadows (sometimes called wicks, as in candle wicks) are the intraday extension outside the open-to-close range.

### Chapter 1. Philosophy of Technical Analysis

> Technical analysis is the study of market action, primarily through the use of charts, for the purpose of forecasting future price trends.
> 
> ...
> 
> There are three premises on which the technical approach is based:
> 
> 1. Market action discounts everything.
> 2. Prices move in trends.
> 3. History repeats itself.
> 
> ...
> 
> The technician believes that anything that can possibly affect the price—fundamentally, politically, psychologically, or otherwise—is actually reflected in the price of that market. It follows, therefore, that a study of price action is all that is required.
> 
> ...
> 
> There is a corollary to the premise that prices move in trends—_a trend in motion is more likely to continue than to reverse_.
> 
> ...
> 
> Since these patterns have worked well in the past, it is assumed that they will continue to work well in the future. They are based on the study of human psychology, which tends not to change. Another way of saying this last premise—that history repeats itself—is that the key to understanding the future lies in a study of the past, or that the future is just a repetition of the past.
> 
> While technical analysis concentrates on the study of market action, fundamental analysis focuses on the economic forces of supply and demand that cause prices to move higher, lower, or stay the same. ... The intrinsic value is what the fundamentals indicate something is actually worth based on the law of supply and demand.
> 
> ...
> 
> _The fundamentalist studies the cause of market movement, while the technician studies the effect_.
> 
> ...
> 
> Usually at the beginning of important market moves, the fundamentals do not explain or support what the market seems to be doing.
> 
> ...
> 
> Chart reading becomes a shortcut form of fundamental analysis. The reverse, however, is not true. Fundamental analysis does not include a study of price action. It is possible to trade financial markets using just the technical approach. It is doubtful that anyone could trade off the fundamentals alone with no consideration of the technical side of the market.
> 
> ... Because of the high leverage factor in the futures markets, timing is especially crucial in that arena.
> 
> ... A “buy and hold” strategy doesn’t apply to the futures arena. Both the technical and the fundamental approach can be used in the first phase—the forecasting process. However, the question of timing, of determining specific entry and exit points, is almost purely technical. Therefore, considering the steps the trader must go through before making a market commitment, it can be seen that the correct application of technical principles becomes indispensable at some point in the process, even if fundamental analysis was applied in the earlier stages of the decision. ...
> 
> One of the great strengths of technical analysis is its adaptability to virtually any trading medium and time dimension. There is no area of trading in either stocks or futures where these principles do not apply.
> 
> ...
> 
> The fundamentalist, however, who tends to specialize in only one group, doesn’t have that kind of flexibility.
> 
> ...
> 
> Rising commodity prices generally hint at a stronger economy and rising inflationary pressure. Falling commodity prices usually warn that the economy is slowing along with inflation. ... As a result, charts of commodity markets like gold and oil, along with Treasury Bonds, can tell us a lot about the strength or weakness of the economy and inflationary expectations. ... Even more impressive is the fact that trends in these futures markets usually show up long before they are reflected in traditional economic indicators that are released on a monthly or quarterly basis, and usually tell us what has already happened.
> 
> ...
> 
> The pricing structure in futures is much more complicated than in stocks. Each commodity is quoted in different units and increments. Grain markets, for example, are quoted in cents per bushel, livestock markets in cents per pound, gold and silver in dollars per ounce, and interest rates in basis points. The trader must learn the contract details of each market: which exchange it is traded on, how each contract is quoted, what the minimum and maximum price increments are, and what these price increments are worth.
> 
> Unlike stocks, futures contracts have expiration dates.
> 
> ...
> 
> All futures are traded on margin, which is usually less than 10% of the value of the contract. ... Relatively small price moves in either direction tend to become magnified in their impact on overall trading results. For this reason, it is possible to make or lose large sums of money very quickly in futures. Because a trader puts up only 10% of the value of the contract as margin, then a 10% move in either direction will either double the trader’s money or wipe it out. ...
> 
> From the standpoint of technical analysis, the high leverage factor makes timing in the futures markets much more critical than it is in stocks. The correct timing of entry and exit points is crucial in futures trading and much more difficult and frustrating than market analysis. Largely for this reason, technical trading skills become indispensable to a successful futures trading program.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Timing is everything in futures trading_. Determining the correct direction of the market only solves a portion of the trading problem. If the timing of the entry point is off by a day, or sometimes even minutes, it can mean the difference between a winner or a loser. It’s bad enough to be on the wrong side of the market and lose money. Being on the right side of the market and still losing money is one of the most frustrating and unnerving aspects of futures trading. It goes without saying that timing is almost purely technical in nature, because the fundamentals rarely change on a day-to-day basis.
> 
> ...
> 
> Technical analysis in stocks relies much more heavily on the use of _sentiment indicators and flow of funds analysis_. Sentiment indicators monitor the performance of different groups such as odd lotters, mutual funds, and floor specialists. Enormous importance is placed on sentiment indicators that measure the overall market bullishness and bearishness on the theory that the majority opinion is usually wrong. _Flow of funds_ analysis refers to the cash position of different groups, such as mutual funds or large institutional accounts. The thinking here is that the larger the cash position, the more funds that are available for stock purchases.
> 
> ...
> 
> The _Random Walk Theory_, developed and nurtured in the academic community, claims that price changes are “serially independent” and that price history is not a reliable indicator of future price direction. In a nutshell, price movement is random and unpredictable. The theory is based on the _efficient market hypothesis_, which holds that prices fluctuate randomly about their intrinsic value. It also holds that the best market strategy to follow would be a simple “buy and hold” strategy as opposed to any attempt to “beat the market.”
> 
> ...
> 
> ... However, the idea that markets are random is totally rejected by the technical community. If the markets were truly random, no forecasting technique would work.

### Chapter 2. Dow Theory

> Charles Dow and his partner Edward Jones founded Dow Jones & Company in 1882. Most technicians and students of the markets concur that much of what we call technical analysis today has its origins in theories first proposed by Dow around the turn of the century. Dow published his ideas in a series of editorials he wrote for the Wall Street Journal. Most technicians today recognize and assimilate Dow’s basic ideas, whether or not they recognize the source. Dow Theory still forms the cornerstone of the study of technical analysis, even in the face of today’s sophisticated computer technology, and the proliferation of newer and supposedly better technical indicators.
> 
> On July 3, 1884, Dow published the first stock market average composed of the closing prices of eleven stocks: nine railroad companies and two manufacturing firms. Dow felt that these eleven stocks provided a good indication of the economic health of the country. In 1897, Dow determined that two separate indices would better represent that health, and created a 12 stock industrial index and a 20 stock rail index. By 1928 the industrial index had grown to include 30 stocks, the number at which it stands today.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dow applied his theoretical work to the stock market averages that he created; namely the Industrials and the Rails. However, most of his analytical ideas apply equally well to all market averages.
> 
> ...
> 
> Sound familiar? The idea that the markets reflect every possible knowable factor that affects overall supply and demand is one of the basic premises of technical theory ... The theory applies to market averages, as well as it does to individual markets, and even makes allowances for “acts of God.” While the markets cannot anticipate events such as earthquakes and various other natural calamities, they quickly discount such occurrences, and almost instantaneously assimilate their affects into the price action.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dow believed that the laws of action and reaction apply to the markets just as they do to the physical universe. He wrote, “Records of trading show that in many cases when a stock reaches top it will have a moderate decline and then go back again to near the highest figures. If after such a move, the price again recedes, it is liable to decline some distance” ...
> 
> Dow considered a trend to have three parts, _primary_, _secondary_, and _minor_, which he compared to the tide, waves, and ripples of the sea. The primary trend represents the tide, the secondary or intermediate trend represents the waves that make up the tide, and the minor trends behave like ripples on the waves.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dow focused his attention on primary or major trends, which he felt usually take place in three distinct phases: an accumulation phase, a public participation phase, and a distribution phase. ... The distribution phase takes place when newspapers begin to print increasingly bullish stories ...
> 
> ...
> 
> Dow, in referring to the Industrial and Rail Averages, meant that no important bull or bear market signal could take place unless both averages gave the same signal, thus confirming each other. He felt that both averages must exceed a previous secondary peak to confirm the inception or continuation of a bull market. He did not believe that the signals had to occur simultaneously, but recognized that a shorter length of time between the two signals provided stronger confirmation. When the two averages diverged from one another, Dow assumed that the prior trend was still maintained. ...
> 
> Dow recognized volume as a secondary but important factor in confirming price signals. Simply stated, _volume should expand or increase in the direction of the major trend_. In a major uptrend, volume would then increase as prices move higher, and diminish as prices fall. In a downtrend, volume should increase as prices drop and diminish as they rally. Dow considered volume a secondary indicator. He based his actual buy and sell signals entirely on closing prices.
> 
> ...
> 
> It relates a physical law to market movement, which states that an object in motion (in this case a trend) tends to continue in motion until some external force causes it to change direction.
>

> 
> ![Basic Tenets: Failure Swing](/.attachments/basic.tent-failure.swing.png)
> 
> _Failure Swing. The failure of the peak at C to overcome A, followed by the violation of the low at B, constitutes a “sell” signal at S._
> 
> ![Basic Tenets: Nonfailure Swing](/.attachments/basic.tenet-nonfailure.swing.png)
> 
> _Nonfailure Swing. Notice that C exceeds A before falling below B. Some Dow theorists would see a “sell” signal at S1, while others would need to see a lower high at E before turning bearish at S2._

> Dow relied exclusively on closing prices. ...
> 
> ![Basic Tenet: Failure Swing Bottom](/.attachments/basic.tenet.buy.signal.png)
>
> _Failure Swing Bottom. The “buy” signal takes place when point B is exceeded (at B1)._
> 
> ...
> 
> In response to this criticism, traders must remember that Dow never intended to anticipate trends; rather he sought to recognize the emergence of major bull and bear markets and to capture the large middle portion of important market moves. ...
> 
> Dow apparently never intended to use his theory to forecast the direction of the stock market. He felt its real value was to use stock market direction as a barometric reading of general business conditions. We can only marvel at Dow’s vision and genius. In addition to formulating a great deal of today’s price forecasting methodology, he was among the first to recognize the usefulness of stock market averages as a leading economic indicator.
> 
> ... 
> 
> ... The standard definition of a trend, the classification of a trend into three categories and phases, the principles of confirmation and divergence, the interpretation of volume, and the use of percentage retracements (to name a few), all derive, in one way or another, from Dow Theory.

### Chapter 4. Basic Concepts of Trend

> The concept of _trend_ is absolutely essential to the technical approach to market analysis. All of the tools used by the chartist—support and resistance levels, price patterns, moving averages, trendlines, etc.—have the sole purpose of helping to measure the trend of the market for the purpose of participating in that trend. We often hear such familiar expressions as “always trade in the direction of the trend,” “never buck the trend,” or “the trend is your friend.” So let’s spend a little time to define what a trend is and classify it into a few categories.
> 
> In a general sense, the trend is simply the direction of the market, which way it’s moving. But we need a more precise definition with which to work. First of all, markets don’t generally move in a straight line in any direction. Market moves are characterized by a series of _zigzags_. These zigzags resemble a series of successive waves with fairly obvious peaks and troughs. _It is the direction of those peaks and troughs that constitutes market trend_.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... trend is usually broken down into the three categories mentioned in the previous chapter. Those three categories are the _major_, _intermediate_, and _near term trends_.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Classification](/.attachments/chart.trends.classification.png)
> 
> _Example of the three degrees of trend: major, secondary, and near term. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 show the major uptrend. Wave 2-3 represents a secondary correction within the major uptrend. Each secondary wave in turn divides into near term trends. For example, secondary wave 2-3 divides into minor waves A-B-C._
>
> ![Chart Trends: Classification - Real Life Visualization](/.attachments/chart.trends.classification-real.png)
> 
> _The major trend (over a year) is up during 1997. A short term correction occurred during March. An intermediate correction lasted from August to November (three months). The intermediate correction broke down into three short term trends._
> 
> Quite a bit of misunderstanding arises because of different traders’ perceptions as to what is meant by a trend. To long term position traders, a few days’ to a few weeks’ price action might be insignificant. To a day trader, a two or three day advance might constitute a major uptrend. It’s especially important, then, to understand the different degrees of trend and to make sure that all involved in a transaction are talking about the same ones.
> 
> As a general statement, most trend-following approaches focus on the intermediate trend, which may last for several months. The near term trend is used primarily for timing purposes. In an intermediate uptrend, short term setbacks would be used to initiate long positions.
> 
> ...
> 
> The troughs, or reaction lows, are called _support_. The term is self-explanatory and indicates that support is a level or area on the chart _under the market_ where buying interest is sufficiently strong to overcome selling pressure. As a result, a decline is halted and prices turn back up again.
> 
> _Resistance_ is the opposite of support and represents a price level or area _over the market_ where selling pressure overcomes buying pressure and a price advance is turned back.
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Resistance and Support](/.attachments/chart.trends.resistance.support.png)
> 
> _Shows rising support and resistance levels in uptrend. Points 2 and 4 are support levels which are usually previous reaction lows. Points 1 and 3 are resistance levels, usually marked by previous peaks._
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Resistance and Support - Down Trend](/.attachments/chart.trends.resistance.support.downtrend.png)
> 
> _Shows support and resistance in a downtrend._
> 
> In an uptrend, the resistance levels represent pauses in that uptrend and are usually exceeded at some point. In a downtrend, support levels are not sufficient to stop the decline permanently, but are able to check it at least temporarily.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... If the support level is violated, then a trend _reversal_ from up to down is likely.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Whenever a support or resistance level is penetrated by a significant amount, they reverse their roles and become the opposite_. In other words, a resistance level becomes a support level and support becomes resistance.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Top Reversal](/.attachments/chart.trends.top.reversal.png)
> 
> _Example of a trend reversal. The failure of prices at point 5 to exceed the previous peak at point 3 followed by a downside violation of the previous low at point 4 constitutes a downside trend reversal. This type of pattern is called a double top._
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Bottom Reversal](/.attachments/chart.trends.bottom.reversal.png)
> 
> _Example of a bottom reversal pattern. Usually the first sign of a bottom is the ability of prices at point 5 to hold above the previous low at point 3. The bottom is confirmed when the peak at 4 is overcome._
> 
> ...
> 
> _The longer the period of time that prices trade in a support or resistance area, the more significant that area becomes_. For example, if prices trade sideways for three weeks in a congestion area before moving higher, that support area would be more important than if only three days of trading had occurred.
> 
> _Volume is another way to measure the significance of support and resistance_. If a support level is formed on heavy volume, this would indicate that a large number of units changed hands, and would mark that support level as more important than if very little trading had taken place. Point and figure charts that measure the intraday trading activity are especially useful in identifying these price levels where most of the trading took place and, consequently, where support and resistance will be most likely to function.
> 
> _A third way to determine the significance of a support or resistance area is how recently the trading took place_. Because we are dealing with the reaction of traders to market movement and to positions that they have already taken or failed to take, it stands to reason that the more recent the activity, the more potent it becomes.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Chart analysis is actually a study of human psychology and the reactions of traders to changing market conditions. ...
> 
> ...
> 
> There is a tendency for round numbers to stop advances or declines. Traders tend to think in terms of important round numbers, such as 10, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100 (and multiples of 1000), as price objectives and act accordingly. These round numbers, therefore, will often act as “psychological” support or resistance levels. A trader can use this information to begin taking profits as an important round number is approached.
> 
> ...
> 
> One trading application of this principle is to _avoid placing trading orders right at these obvious round numbers_. ... As a general rule, _avoid placing protective stops at obvious round numbers_.

> 
> ...
> 
> It was mentioned earlier that support and resistance levels became the opposite once violated. The same principle holds true of trendlines. In other words, an up trendline (a support line) will usually become a resistance line once it’s decisively broken. A down trendline (a resistance line) will often become a support line once it’s decisively broken. This is why it’s usually a good idea to project all trendlines as far out to the right on the chart as possible even after they’ve been broken.
>
> This brings us to another interesting use of the trendline—the _fan principle_. ... The term “fan principle” derives from the appearance of the lines that gradually flatten out, resembling a fan. _The important point to remember here is that the breaking of the third line is the valid trend reversal signal_.
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Fan Principle - Breaking Up trend](/.attachments/chart.trends.fan.principle-1.png)

> 
> ...
> 
> In examining the three lines in the fan principle, it’s interesting to note how often the number three shows up in the study of technical analysis and the important role it plays in so many technical approaches. For example, the fan principle uses three lines; major bull and bear markets usually have three major phases (Dow Theory and Elliott Wave Theory); there are three kinds of gaps (to be covered shortly); some of the more commonly known reversal patterns, such as the triple top and the head and shoulders, have three prominent peaks; there are three different classifications of trend (major, secondary, and minor) and three trend directions (up, down, and sideways); among the generally accepted continuation patterns, there are three types of triangles—the symmetrical, ascending, and descending; there are three principle sources of information—price, volume, and open interest. For whatever the reason, the number three plays a very prominent role throughout the entire field of technical analysis.

> 
> ![Chart Trends: Relative Steepness](/.attachments/chart.trends.steepness.png)
> 
> _Most valid trendlines rise at an angle approximating 45 degrees (see line 2). If the trendline is too steep (line 1), it usually indicates that the rate of ascent is not sustainable. A trendline that is too flat (line 3) suggests that the uptrend is too weak and probably suspect. Many technicians use 45 degree lines from previous tops or bottoms as major trendlines._
> 
> ...
> 
> In the case of an accelerating trend, sometimes several trendlines may have to be drawn at increasingly steeper angles. In my experience, however, where steeper trendlines become necessary, it is best to resort to another tool—_the moving average_—which is the same as a curvilinear trendline. One of the advantages of having access to several different types of technical indicators is being able to choose the one most appropriate for a given situation. All of the techniques covered in this book work well in certain situations, but not so well in others. By having an arsenal of tools to fall back on, the technician can quickly switch from one tool to another that might work better in a given situation. An accelerated trend is one of those cases where a moving average would be more useful than a series of steeper and steeper trendlines.
> 
> ...
>
> The _channel line_, or the _return line_ as it is sometimes called, is another useful variation of the trendline technique. Sometimes prices trend between two parallel lines—the basic trendline and the channel line. Obviously, when this is the case and when the analyst recognizes that a channel exists, this knowledge can be used to profitable advantage.

> 
> The breaking of the major trendline indicates an important change in trend.

The failure of prices to reach the top of the channel (at point 5 in chart above) may be an early warning that the trend is turning, and increases the odds that the other line (the basic up trendline) will be broken. As a general rule of thumb, the failure of any move within an established price channel to reach one side of the channel usually indicates that the trend is shifting, and increases the likelihood that the other side of the channel will be broken.

> 
> Besides the 50% retracement, there are minimum and maximum percentage parameters that are also widely recognized—_the one-third and the two-thirds retracements_. In other words, the price trend can be divided into thirds. Usually, a minimum retracement is about 33% and a maximum about 66%. What this means is that, in a correction of a strong trend, the market usually retraces at least a third of the previous move. This is very useful information for a number of reasons. If a trader is looking for a buying area under the market, he or she can just compute a 33-50% zone on the chart and use that price zone as a general frame of reference for buying opportunities.

When we get to the Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci ratios, we will see that followers of that approach use percentage retracements of 38% and 62%. I prefer to combine both approaches for a minimum retracement zone of 33-38% and a maximum zone of 62-66%. Some technicians round off these numbers even further to arrive at a 40-60% retracement zone.

The 38% and 62% lines are Fibonacci retracements and are popular with chartists._

Fibonacci retracement levels are used in technical analysis because of their perceived significance in identifying potential levels of support and resistance in financial markets. The Fibonacci sequence and its associated ratios are believed to reflect natural patterns and occurrences found in various aspects of life, including financial markets.

The significance lies in the observation that these ratios, derived from the Fibonacci sequence (like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, etc.), tend to correspond with levels where price corrections often occur within a larger trend. Here are a few reasons why they are used:

1. **Nature's Presence**: The Fibonacci sequence and ratios appear in natural phenomena, from the arrangement of leaves on plants to the proportions of the human body. This prevalence in nature leads some to believe that these ratios may also influence market behavior.

2. **Psychological Levels**: Many traders and analysts believe that these Fibonacci levels are psychologically important to market participants. As a result, when these levels are reached, traders may buy or sell, causing price reactions.

3. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**: The widespread use of Fibonacci retracements by traders and analysts means that these levels often become self-fulfilling prophecies. As more people use and act upon these levels, they can impact market behavior.

4. **Support and Resistance**: The levels derived from the Fibonacci sequence are believed to represent potential areas of support (where prices may stop falling) or resistance (where prices may stop rising) within a larger trend.

However, it's important to note that while Fibonacci retracements are widely used, they are not foolproof indicators. Market movements are influenced by various factors, and these levels should ideally be used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools and indicators for more robust trading decisions.

> Speaking of thirds, let’s touch on another technique that combines the trendline with percentage retracements—speedlines. This technique, developed by Edson Gould, is actually an adaptation of the idea of dividing the trend into thirds. The main difference from the percentage retracement concept is that the speed resistance lines (or speedlines) measure the rate of ascent or descent of a trend (in other words, its speed).
> 
> To construct a bullish _speedline_, find the highest point in the current uptrend. From that high point on the chart, a vertical line is drawn toward the bottom of the chart to where the trend began. That vertical line is then divided into thirds. A trendline is then drawn from the beginning of the trend through the two points marked off on the vertical line, representing the one-third and two-thirds points.
> 
> In a downtrend, just reverse the process. Measure the vertical distance from the low point in the downtrend to the beginning of the trend, and draw two lines from the beginning of the trend through the one-third and two-thirds points on the vertical line.

> 
> _Examples of speed resistance lines in an uptrend. The vertical distance from the peak to the beginning of the trend is divided into thirds. Two trendlines are then drawn from point 1 through points 2 and 3. The upper line is the 2/3 speedline and the lower, the 1/3. The lines should act as support during market corrections. When they’re broken, they revert to resistance lines on bounces. Sometimes these speedlines intersect price action._
> 
> Each time a new high is set in an uptrend or a new low in a downtrend, a new set of lines must be drawn (because there is now a new high or low point). Because the _speedlines_ are drawn from the beginning of the trend to the one-third and two-thirds points, those trendlines may sometimes move through some of the price action. This is one case where trendlines are not drawn under lows or over highs, but actually through the price action.
> 
> ...
> 
> Charting software also allows the drawing of _Gann_ and _Fibonacci_ fan lines. _Fibonacci_ fan lines are drawn in the same fashion as the speedline. Except that Fibonacci lines are drawn at 38% and 62% angles. _Gann_ lines (named after the legendary commodity trader, W.D. Gann) are trendlines drawn from prominent tops or bottoms at specific geometric angles. The most important Gann line is drawn at a 45 degree angle from a peak or trough. Steeper Gann lines can be drawn during an uptrend at 63 3⁄ 4 degree and 75 degree angles. Flatter Gann lines can be drawn at 26 1⁄ 4 and 15 degree lines. It’s possible to draw as many as nine different Gann lines.
> 
> Gann and Fibonacci lines are used in the same way as speedlines. They are supposed to provide support during downward corrections. When one line is broken, prices will usually fall to the next lower line. Gann lines are somewhat controversial. Even if one of them works, you can’t be sure in advance which one it will be. Some chartists question the validity of drawing geometric trendlines at all.

> A _reversal day_ takes place either at a top or a bottom. The generally accepted definition of a _top reversal day_ is the setting of a new high in an uptrend, followed by a lower close on the same day. In other words, prices set a new high for a given upmove at some point during the day (usually at or near the opening) then weaken and actually close lower than the previous day’s closing. A _bottom reversal day_ would be a new low during the day followed by a higher close.
>

> 
> The bottom reversal day is sometimes referred to as a _selling climax_. This is usually a dramatic turnaround at the bottom of a down move where all the discouraged longs have finally been forced out of the market on heavy volume. The subsequent absence of selling pressure creates a vacuum over the market, which prices quickly rally to fill. The selling climax is one of the more dramatic examples of the reversal day and, while it may not mark the final bottom of a falling market, it usually signals that a significant low has been seen.

> Price _gaps_ are simply areas on the bar chart where no trading has taken place. In an uptrend, for example, prices open above the highest price of the previous day, leaving a gap or open space on the chart that is not filled during the day. In a downtrend, the day’s highest price is below the previous day’s low. Upside gaps are signs of market strength, while downside gaps are usually signs of weakness. Gaps can appear on long term weekly and monthly charts and, when they do, are usually very significant. But they are more commonly seen on daily bar charts.

> Several myths exist concerning the interpretation of gaps. One of the maxims often heard is that “gaps are always filled.” This is simply not true. Some should be filled and others shouldn’t. We’ll also see that gaps have different forecasting implications depending on which types they are and where they occur.
> 
> There are three general types of gaps—_the breakaway_, _runaway (or measuring)_, and _exhaustion gaps_.
> 
> The _breakaway gap_ usually occurs at the completion of an important price pattern, and usually signals the beginning of a significant market move. After a market has completed a major basing pattern, the breaking of resistance often occurs on a breakaway gap. Major breakouts from topping or basing areas are breeding grounds for this type of gap. The breaking of a major trendline, signaling a reversal of trend, might also see a breakaway gap.
> 
> Breakaway gaps usually occur on heavy volume. More often than not, breakaway gaps are not filled. Prices may return to the upper end of the gap (in the case of a bullish breakout), and may even close a portion of the gap, but some portion of the gap is often left unfilled. As a rule, the heavier the volume after such a gap appears, the less likely it is to be filled. Upside gaps usually act as support areas on subsequent market corrections. It’s important that prices not fall below gaps during an uptrend. In all cases a close below an upward gap is a sign of weakness.

Notice that the breakaway and runaway gaps were not filled on the way up, which is often the case._
> 
> After the move has been underway for awhile, somewhere around the middle of the move, prices will leap forward to form a second type of gap (or a series of gaps) called the _runaway gap_. This type of gap reveals a situation where the market is moving effortlessly on moderate volume. In an uptrend, it’s a sign of market strength; in a downtrend, a sign of weakness. Here again, runaway gaps act as support under the market on subsequent corrections and are often not filled. As in the case of the breakaway, a close below the runaway gap is a negative sign in an uptrend.

> 
> This variety of gap is also called a _measuring gap_ because it usually occurs at about the halfway point in a trend. By measuring the distance the trend has already traveled, from the original trend signal or breakout, an estimate of the probable extent of the remaining move can be determined by doubling the amount already achieved.
> 
> The final type of gap appears near the end of a market move. After all objectives have been achieved and the other two types of gaps (breakaway and runaway) have been identified, the analyst should begin to expect the _exhaustion gap_. Near the end of an uptrend, prices leap forward in a last gasp, so to speak. However, that upward leap quickly fades and prices turn lower within a couple of days or within a week. When prices close under that last gap, it is usually a dead giveaway that the exhaustion gap has made its appearance. This is a classic example where falling below a gap in an uptrend has very bearish implications.
> 
> This takes us to the _island reversal pattern_. Sometimes after the upward exhaustion gap has formed, prices will trade in a narrow range for a couple of days or a couple of weeks before gapping to the downside. Such a situation leaves the few days of price action looking like an “island” surrounded by space or water. The exhaustion gap to the upside followed by a breakaway gap to the downside completes the island reversal pattern and usually indicates a trend reversal of some magnitude. Of course, the major significance of the reversal depends on where prices are in the general trend structure.

### Chapter 5. Major Reversal Patterns

> There are two major categories of price patterns—reversal and continuation. As these names imply, reversal patterns indicate that an important reversal in trend is taking place. The continuation patterns, on the other hand, suggest that the market is only pausing for awhile, possibly to correct a near term overbought or oversold condition, after which the existing trend will be resumed. The trick is to distinguish between the two types of patterns as early as possible during the formation of the pattern.
>

> **Preliminary Points Common to All Reversal Patterns**

> Before beginning our discussion of the individual major reversal patterns, there are a few preliminary points to be considered that are common to all of these reversal patterns.
> 
> 1. A prerequisite for any reversal pattern is the existence of a prior trend.
> 2. The first signal of an impending trend reversal is often the breaking of an important trendline.
> 3. The larger the pattern, the greater the subsequent move.
> 4. Topping patterns are usually shorter in duration and more volatile than bottoms.
> 5. Bottoms usually have smaller price ranges and take longer to build.
> 6. Volume is usually more important on the upside.
> 
> ...
> 
> Price swings within the tops are wider and more violent. Tops usually take less time to form. Bottoms usually have smaller price ranges, but take longer to build. For this reason it is usually easier and less costly to identify and trade bottoms than to catch market tops. One consoling factor, which makes the more treacherous topping patterns worthwhile, is that _prices tend to decline faster than they go up_.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Markets have a way of “falling of their own weight” once a bear move gets underway. Chartists like to see an increase in trading activity as prices drop, but it is not critical. At bottoms, however, the volume pickup is absolutely essential. If the volume pattern does not show a significant increase during the upside price breakout, the entire price pattern should be questioned.

> _Example of a head and shoulders top. The left and right shoulders (A and E) are at about the same height. The head (C) is higher than either shoulder. Notice the lighter volume on each peak. The pattern is completed on a close under the neckline (line 2). The minimum objective is the vertical distance from the head to the neckline projected downward from the breaking of the neckline. A return move will often occur back to the neckline, which should not recross the neckline once it has been broken._
> 
> [From the illustration above, note that] Prices then begin to decline to point D and something even more disturbing happens. The decline carries below the top of the previous peak at point A. Remember that, in an uptrend, a penetrated peak should function as support on subsequent corrections. The decline well under point A, almost to the previous reaction low at point B, is another warning that something may be going wrong with the uptrend.
> 
> The market rallies again to point E, this time on even lighter volume, and isn’t able to reach the top of the previous peak at point C. (That last rally at point E will often retrace one-half to two-thirds of the decline from points C to D.) To continue an uptrend, each high point must exceed the high point of the rally preceding it. The failure of the rally at point E to reach the previous peak at point C fulfills half of the requirement for a new downtrend—namely, descending peaks.
> 
> By this time, the major up trendline (line 1) has already been broken, usually at point D, constituting another danger signal. But, despite all of these warnings, all that we know at this point is that the trend has shifted from up to sideways. This might be sufficient cause to liquidate long positions, but not necessarily enough to justify new short sales.
> 
> ... _The deciding factor in the resolution of the head and shoulders top is a decisive closing violation of that neckline_. The market has now violated the trendline along the bottom of points B and D, has broken under support at point D, and has completed the requirement for a new downtrend—descending peaks and troughs. The new downtrend is now identified by the declining highs and lows at points C, D, E, and F. Volume should increase on the breaking of the neckline. A sharp increase in downside volume, however, is not critically important in the initial stages of a market top.
> 
> The accompanying volume pattern plays an important role in the development of the head and shoulders top as it does in all price patterns. As a general rule, the second peak (the head) should take place on lighter volume than the left shoulder. This is not a requirement, but a strong tendency and an early warning of diminishing buying pressure. The most important volume signal takes place during the third peak (the right shoulder). Volume should be noticeably lighter than on the previous two peaks. Volume should then expand on the breaking of the neckline, decline during the return move, and then expand again once the return move is over.
> 
> As mentioned earlier, volume is less critical during the completion of market tops. But, at some point, volume should begin to increase if the new downtrend is to be continued. Volume plays a much more decisive role at market bottoms, a subject to be discussed shortly. Before doing so, however, let’s discuss the measuring implications of the head and shoulders pattern.

> 
> The most important difference between the top and bottom patterns is the volume sequence. Volume plays a much more critical role in the identification and completion of a head and shoulders bottom. This point is generally true of all bottom patterns. It was stated earlier that markets have a tendency to “fall of their own weight.” At bottoms, however, markets require a significant increase in buying pressure, reflected in greater volume, to launch a new bull market.
> 
> A more technical way of looking at this difference is that a market can fall just from inertia. Lack of demand or buying interest on the part of traders is often enough to push a market lower; but a market does not go up on inertia. Prices only rise when demand exceeds supply and buyers are more aggressive than sellers.
> 
> The volume pattern at the bottom is very similar to that at the top for the first half of the pattern. That is, the volume at the head is a bit lighter than that at the left shoulder. The rally from the head, however, should begin to show not only an increase in trading activity, but the level of volume often exceeds that registered on the rally from the left shoulder. The dip to the right shoulder should be on very light volume. The critical point occurs at the rally through the neckline. This signal must be accompanied by a sharp burst of trading volume if the breakout is for real.
> 
> This point is where the bottom differs the most from the top. At the bottom, heavy volume is an absolutely essential ingredient in the completion of the basing pattern. The return move is more common at bottoms than at tops and should occur on light volume. Following that, the new uptrend should resume on heavier volume. The measuring technique is the same as at the top.
> 
> ...
> 
> Market tactics play an important role in all trading. Not all technical traders like to wait for the breaking of the neckline before initiating a new position. ... more aggressive traders, believing that they have correctly identified a head and shoulders bottom, will begin to probe the long side during the formation of the right shoulder. Or they will buy the first technical signal that the decline into the right shoulder has ended.
> 
> ...
> 
> Once prices have moved through the neckline and completed a head and shoulders pattern, _prices should not recross the neckline again_. At a top, once the neckline has been broken on the downside, any decisive close back above the neckline is a serious warning that the initial breakdown was probably a bad signal, and creates what is often called, for obvious reasons, _a failed head and shoulders_. This type of pattern starts out looking like a classic head and shoulders reversal, but at some point in its development (either prior to the breaking of the neckline or just after it), prices resume their original trend.

One-half to two-thirds pullback of the rally from points C to D, a decline to the same level as the left shoulder at point A, or the breaking of a short term down trendline (line 1) all provide early opportunities for market entry. More positions can be added on the breaking of the neckline or the return move back to the neckline._
> 
> There are two important lessons here. The first is that none of these chart patterns are infallible. They work most of the time, but not always. The second lesson is that technical traders must always be on the alert for chart signs that their analysis is incorrect. One of the keys to survival in the financial markets is to keep trading losses small and to exit a losing trade as quickly as possible. One of the greatest advantages of chart analysis is its ability to quickly alert the trader to the fact that he or she is on the wrong side of the market. The ability and willingness to quickly recognize trading errors and to take defensive action immediately are qualities not to be taken lightly in the financial markets.

> ...
> 
> Most of the points covered in the treatment of the head and shoulders pattern are also applicable to other types of reversal patterns. The triple top or bottom, which is much rarer in occurrence, is just a slight variation of that pattern. The main difference is that the three peaks or troughs in the triple top or bottom are at about the same level. Chartists often disagree as to whether a reversal pattern is a head and shoulders or a triple top. The argument is academic, because both patterns imply the exact same thing.
> 
> The volume tends to decline with each successive peak at the top and should increase at the breakdown point. The triple top is not complete until support levels along both of the intervening lows have been broken. Conversely, prices must close through the two intervening peaks at the bottom to complete a triple bottom. (As an alternate strategy, the breaking of the nearest peak or trough can also be used as a reversal signal.) Heavy upside volume on the completion of the bottom is also essential.

Because the triple top or bottom represents only a minor variation of the head and shoulders pattern, we won’t say much more about it here.
> 
> A much more common reversal pattern is the double top or bottom. Next to the head and shoulders, it is the most frequently seen and the most easily recognized. For obvious reasons, the top is often referred to as an “M” and the bottom as a “W.” The general characteristics of a double top are similar to that of the head and shoulders and triple top except that only two peaks appear instead of three.

On occasion, the second peak will not quite reach the level of the first peak, which is not too problematical. What does cause some problems is when the second peak actually exceeds the first peak by a slight margin. What at first may appear to be a valid upside breakout and resumption of the uptrend may turn out to be part of the topping process. To help resolve this dilemma, some of the filtering criteria already mentioned may come in handy.
> 
> Most chartists require a close beyond a previous resistance peak instead of just an intraday penetration. Second, a price filter of some type might be used. One such example is a percentage penetration criterion (such as 1% or 3%). Third, the two day penetration rule could be used as an example of a time filter. In other words, prices would have to close beyond the top of the first peak for two consecutive days to signal a valid penetration. Another time filter could be a Friday close beyond the previous peak. The volume on the upside breakout might also provide a clue to its reliability.
> 
> These filters are certainly not infallible, but do serve to reduce the number of false signals (or whipsaws) that often occur. Sometimes these filters are helpful, and sometimes they’re not. The analyst must face the realization that he or she is dealing with percentages and probabilities, and that there will be times when bad signals occur. That’s simply a fact of trading life.

> 
> The terms “double top and bottom” are greatly overused in the financial markets. Most potential double tops or bottoms wind up being something else. The reason for this is that prices have a strong tendency to back off from a previous peak or bounce off a previous low. These price changes are a natural reaction and do not in themselves constitute a reversal pattern. Remember that, at a top, prices must actually violate the previous reaction low before the double top exists.

> 
> ...
> 
> ... It is very difficult for the chartist to determine whether the pullback from the previous peak or the bounce from the previous low is just a temporary setback in the existing trend or the start of a double top or bottom reversal pattern. Because the technical odds usually favor continuation of the present trend, it is usually wise to await completion of the pattern before taking action.

### Chapter 6. Continuation Patterns

> Reversal patterns usually take much longer to build and represent major trend changes. Continuation patterns, on the other hand, are usually shorter term in duration and are more accurately classified as near term or intermediate patterns.
> 
> ...
> 
> There are three types of triangles—symmetrical, ascending, and descending. (Some chartists include a fourth type of triangle known as an expanding triangle, or broadening formation. This is treated as a separate pattern later.) Each type of triangle has a slightly different shape and has different forecasting implications.
> 
> The symmetrical triangle shows two converging trendlines, the upper line descending and the lower line ascending. The vertical line at the left, measuring the height of the pattern, is called the base. The point of intersection at the right, where the two lines meet, is called the apex. For obvious reasons, the symmetrical triangle is also called a coil.
> 
> The ascending triangle has a rising lower line with a flat or horizontal upper line The descending triangle, by contrast, has the upper line declining with a flat or horizontal bottom line. Let’s see how each one is interpreted.
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bullish Symmetrical](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-symmetrical.png)
> 
> _Example of a bullish symmetrical triangle. Notice the two converging trendlines. A close outside either trendline completes the pattern. The vertical line at the left is the base. The point at the right where the two lines meet is the apex._
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Ascending Triangle](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-ascending.png)
> 
> _Example of a bullish symmetrical triangle. Notice the two converging trendlines. A close outside either trendline completes the pattern. The vertical line at the left is the base. The point at the right where the two lines meet is the apex._
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Descending Triangle](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-descending.png)
> 
> _Example of a descending triangle. Notice the flat bottom line and the declining upper line. This is usually a bearish pattern._
> 
> **THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE**
> 
> The _symmetrical triangle_ (or the coil) is usually a continuation pattern. It represents a pause in the existing trend after which the original trend is resumed. ...
> 
> The minimum requirement for a triangle is four reversal points. Remember that it always takes two points to draw a trendline. Therefore, in order to draw two converging trendlines, each line must be touched at least twice.
> 
> ...
> 
> There is a time limit for the resolution of the pattern, and that is the point where the two lines meet—at the apex. As a general rule, prices should break out in the direction of the prior trend somewhere between two-thirds to three-quarters of the horizontal width of the triangle. That is, the distance from the vertical base on the left of the pattern to the apex at the far right. Because the two lines must meet at some point, that time distance can be measured once the two converging lines are drawn. An upside breakout is signaled by a penetration of the upper trendline. If prices remain within the triangle beyond the three-quarters point, the triangle begins to lose its potency, and usually means that prices will continue to drift out to the apex and beyond.
> 
> ...
> 
> The actual trend signal is given by a closing penetration of one of the trendlines. Sometimes a return move will occur back to the penetrated trendline after the breakout. In an uptrend, that line has become a support line. In a downtrend, the lower line becomes a resistance line once it’s broken. The apex also acts as an important support or resistance level after the breakout occurs. Various penetration criteria can be applied to the breakout, similar to those covered in the previous two chapters. A minimum penetration criterion would be a closing price outside the trendline and not just an intraday penetration.
> 
> Volume should diminish as the price swings narrow within the triangle. This tendency for volume to contract is true of all consolidation patterns. But the volume should pick up noticeably at the penetration of the trendline that completes the pattern. The return move should be on light volume with heavier activity again as the trend resumes.
> 
> Two other points should be mentioned about volume. As is the case with reversal patterns, volume is more important on the upside than on the downside. An increase in volume is essential to the resumption of an uptrend in all consolidation patterns.
> 
> The second point about volume is that, even though trading activity diminishes during formation of the pattern, a close inspection of the volume usually gives a clue as to whether the heavier volume is occurring during the upmoves or down-moves. In an uptrend, for example, there should be a slight tendency for volume to be heavier during the bounces and lighter on the price dips.
> 
> ...
>
> **THE ASCENDING TRIANGLE**
> 
> The ascending and descending triangles are variations of the symmetrical, but have different forecasting implications.
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: An Ascending Triangle](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-ascending.triangle.png)
> 
> _An ascending triangle. The pattern is completed on a decisive close above the upper line. This breakout should see a sharp increase in volume. That upper resistance line should act as support on subsequent dips after the breakout. The minimum price objective is obtained by measuring the height of the triangle (AB) and projecting that distance upward from the breakout point at C._
> 
> Notice that the upper trendline is flat, while the lower line is rising. This pattern indicates that buyers are more aggressive than sellers. It is considered a bullish pattern and is usually resolved with a breakout to the upside.
> 
> ... No matter where in the trend structure the ascending or descending triangles appear, they have very definite forecasting implications. The ascending triangle is bullish and the descending triangle is bearish. The symmetrical triangle, by contrast, is inherently a neutral pattern. This does not mean, however, that the symmetrical triangle does not have forecasting value. On the contrary, because the symmetrical triangle is a continuation pattern, the analyst must simply look to see the direction of the previous trend and then make the assumption that the previous trend will continue.
> 
> ...
> 
> **THE DESCENDING TRIANGLE**
> 
> The _descending triangle_ is just a mirror image of the ascending, and is generally considered a bearish pattern. ...
> 
> ...
>
> ![Continuation Patterns: A Descending Triangle](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-descending.triangle.png)
> 
> _A descending triangle. The bearish pattern is completed with a decisive close under the lower flat line. The measuring technique is the height of the triangle (AB) projected down from the breakout at point C._
> 
> This pattern indicates that sellers are more aggressive than buyers, and is usually resolved on the downside. The downside signal is registered by a decisive close under the lower trendline, usually on increased volume. A return move sometimes occurs which should encounter resistance at the lower trendline.
> 
> ...
> 
> The volume pattern in both the ascending and descending triangles is very similar in that the volume diminishes as the pattern works itself out and then increases on the breakout. As in the case of the symmetrical triangle, during the formation the chartist can detect subtle shifts in the volume pattern coinciding with the swings in the price action. This means that in the ascending pattern, the volume tends to be slightly heavier on bounces and lighter on dips. In the descending formation, volume should be heavier on the downside and lighter during the bounces.
> 
> One final factor to be considered on the subject of triangles is that of the time dimension. The triangle is considered an intermediate pattern, meaning that it usually takes longer than a month to form, but generally less than three months. A triangle that lasts less than a month is probably a different pattern, such as a pennant, ...
> 
> **THE BROADENING FORMATION**
> 
> This next price pattern is an unusual variation of the triangle and is relatively rare. It is actually an inverted triangle or a triangle turned backwards. All of the triangular patterns examined so far show converging trendlines. The _broadening formation,_ as the name implies, is just the opposite. ...
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Broadening Top](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-broadening.top.png)
> 
> _A broadening top. This type of expanding triangle usually occurs at major tops. It shows three successively higher peaks and two declining troughs. The violation of the second trough completes the pattern. This is an unusually difficult pattern to trade and fortunately is relatively rare._
> 
> The volume pattern also differs in this formation. In the other triangular patterns, volume tends to diminish as the price swings grow narrower. Just the opposite happens in the broadening formation. _The volume tends to expand along with the wider price swings_. This situation represents a market that is out of control and unusually emotional. Because this pattern also represents an unusual amount of public participation, it most often occurs at major market tops. _The expanding pattern, therefore, is usually a bearish formation_. It generally appears near the end of a major bull market.
> 
> **FLAGS AND PENNANTS**
> 
> The _flag_ and _pennant_ formations are quite common. They are usually treated together because they are very similar in appearance, tend to show up at about the same place in an existing trend, and have the same volume and measuring criteria.
> 
> The _flag_ and _pennant_ represent brief pauses in a dynamic market move. In fact, one of the requirements for both the flag and the pennant is that they be preceded by a sharp and almost straight line move. They represent situations where a steep advance or decline has gotten ahead of itself, and where the market pauses briefly to “catch its breath” before running off again in the same direction.
> 
> Flags and pennants are among the most reliable of continuation patterns and only rarely produce a trend reversal.
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bullish Flag](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bullish.flag.png)
> 
> _Example of a bullish flag. The flag usually occurs after a sharp move and represents a brief pause in the trend. The flag should slope against the trend. Volume should dry up during the formation and build again on the breakout. The flag usually occurs near the midpoint of the move._
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bullish Pennant](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bullish.pennant.png)
> 
> _A bullish pennant. Resembles a small symmetrical triangle, but usually lasts no longer than three weeks. Volume should be light during its formation. The move after the pennant is completed should duplicate the size of the move preceding it._
> 
> ... notice the steep price advance preceding the formations on heavy volume. Notice also the dramatic drop off in activity as the consolidation patterns form and then the sudden burst of activity on the upside breakout.
> 
> The pennant is identified by two converging trendlines and is more horizontal. It very closely resembles a small symmetrical triangle. An important requirement is that volume should dry up noticeably while each of the patterns is forming.
> 
> Both patterns are relatively short term and should be completed within one to three weeks. Pennants and flags in downtrends tend to take even less time to develop, and often last no longer than one or two weeks. Both patterns are completed on the penetration of the upper trendline in an uptrend. The breaking of the lower trendline would signal resumption of downtrends. The breaking of those trendlines should take place on heavier volume. As usual, upside volume is more critically important than downside volume.
> 
> ...
> 
> **THE WEDGE FORMATION**
> 
> The _wedge_ formation is similar to a symmetrical triangle both in terms of its shape and the amount of time it takes to form. Like the symmetrical triangle, it is identified by two converging trendlines that come together at an _apex_. In terms of the amount of time it takes to form, the wedge usually lasts more than one month but not more than three months, putting it into the intermediate category.
> 
> What distinguishes the _wedge_ is its noticeable slant. The wedge pattern has a noticeable slant either to the upside or the downside. As a rule, like the flag pattern, the wedge slants against the prevailing trend. Therefore, a _falling wedge is considered bullish and a rising wedge is bearish_.
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bullish Failing Wedge](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bullish.failing.wedge.png)
> 
> _Example of a bullish falling wedge. The wedge pattern has two converging trendlines, but slopes against the prevailing trend. A falling wedge is usually bullish._
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bearish Wedge](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bearish.wedge.png)
> 
> _Example of a bearish wedge. A bearish wedge should slope upward against the prevailing downtrend._
> 
> _Wedges_ show up most often within the existing trend and usually constitute continuation patterns. The wedge can appear at tops or bottoms and signal a trend reversal. But that type of situation is much less common. Near the end of an uptrend, the chartist may observe a clearcut rising wedge. Because a continuation wedge in an uptrend should slope downward against the prevailing trend, the rising wedge is a clue to the chartist that this is a bearish and not a bullish pattern. At bottoms, a falling wedge would be a tip-off of a possible end of a bear trend.
> 
> Whether the wedge appears in the middle or the end of a market move, the market analyst should always be guided by the general maxim that _a rising wedge is bearish and a falling wedge is bullish_.
> 
> **THE RECTANGLE FORMATION**
> 
> The _rectangle formation_ often goes by other names, but is usually easy to spot on a price chart. It represents a pause in the trend during which prices move sideways between two parallel horizontal lines.
> 
> The rectangle is sometimes referred to as a _trading range_ or a _congestion area_. In Dow Theory parlance, it is referred to as a line. Whatever it is called, it usually represents just a consolidation period in the existing trend, and is usually resolved in the direction of the market trend that preceded its occurrence. In terms of forecasting value, it can be viewed as being similar to the symmetrical triangle but with flat instead of converging trendlines.
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bullish Rectangle](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bullish.rectangle.png)
> 
> _Example of a bullish rectangle in an uptrend. This pattern is also called a trading range, and shows prices trading between two horizontal trendlines. It is also called a congestion area._
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bearish Rectangle](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bearish.rectangle.png)
> 
> _Example of a bearish rectangle. While rectangles are usually considered continuation patterns, the trader must always be alert for signs that it may turn into a reversal pattern, such as a triple bottom._
> 
> A decisive close outside either the upper or lower boundary signals completion of the rectangle and points the direction of the trend. The market analyst must always be on the alert, however, that the rectangular consolidation does not turn into a reversal pattern. ...
> 
> One important clue to watch for is the volume pattern. Because the price swings in both directions are fairly broad, the analyst should keep a close eye on which moves have the heavier volume. If the rallies are on heavier and the setbacks on lighter volume, then the formation is probably a continuation in the uptrend. If the heavier volume is on the downside, then it can be considered a warning of a possible trend reversal in the works.
> 
> Some chartists trade the swings within such a pattern by buying dips near the bottom and selling rallies near the top of the range. This technique enables the short term trader to take advantage of the well defined price boundaries, and profit from an otherwise trendless market. Because the positions are being taken at the extremes of the range, the risks are relatively small and well defined. If the trading range remains intact, this countertrend trading approach works quite well. When a breakout does occur, the trader not only exits the last losing trade immediately, but can reverse the previous position by initiating a new trade in the direction of the new trend. Oscillators are especially useful in sideways trading markets, but less useful once the breakout has occurred ...
> 
> Other traders assume the rectangle is a continuation pattern and take long positions near the lower end of the price band in an uptrend, or initiate short positions near the top of the range in downtrends. Others avoid such trendless markets altogether and await a clearcut breakout before committing their funds. Most trend-following systems perform very poorly during these periods of sideways and trendless market action.
> 
> ...
> 
> **THE CONTINUATION HEAD AND SHOULDERS PATTERN**
> 
> ... The head and shoulders pattern can sometimes appear as a continuation instead of a reversal pattern.
> 
> In the continuation head and shoulders variety, prices trace out a pattern that looks very similar to a sideways rectangular pattern except that the middle trough in an uptrend tends to be lower than either of the two shoulders.
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bullish Continuation Head & Shoulders](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bullish.continuation.head.and.shoulders.png)
> 
> _Example of a bullish continuation head and shoulders pattern._

> n a downtrend, the middle peak in the consolidation exceeds the other two peaks. The result in both cases is a head and shoulders pattern turned upside down. Because it is turned upside down, there is no chance of confusing it with the reversal pattern.

### Chapter 7. Volume and Open Interest

> ... _Price_ is by far the most important. _Volume_ and _open interest_ are secondary in importance and are used primarily as confirming indicators. Of those two, volume is the more important.
> 
> ...
> 
> Open interest represents the total number of outstanding longs or shorts in the market, _not the sum of both_. Open interest is the number of contracts. A contract must have both a _buyer_ and a _seller_. Therefore, two market participants—a _buyer_ and a _seller_—combine to create only one contract. The open interest figure reported each day is followed by either a positive or negative number showing the increase or decrease in the number of contracts for that day. It is those changes in the open interest levels, either up or down, that give the chartist clues as to the changing character of market participation and give open interest its forecasting value.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... if both participants in a trade are initiating a new position, the open interest will increase. If both are liquidating an old position, the open interest will decline. If, however, one is initiating a new trade while the other is liquidating an old trade, open interest will remain unchanged. By looking at the net change in the total open interest at the end of the day, the chartist is able to determine whether money is flowing into or out of the market. This information enables the analyst to draw some conclusions about the strength or weakness of the current price trend.
> 
> ...
> 
> The level of volume measures the intensity or urgency behind the price move. Heavier volume reflects a higher degree of intensity or pressure. By monitoring the level of volume along with price action, the technician is better able to gauge the buying or selling pressure behind market moves. This information can then be used to confirm price movement or warn that a price move is not to be trusted.
> 
> To state the rule more concisely, _volume should increase or expand in the direction of the existing price trend_. In an uptrend, volume should be heavier as the price moves higher, and should decrease or contract on price dips. As long as this pattern continues, volume is said to be confirming the price trend.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Continuation patterns, like the _triangle_, should be accompanied by a gradual drop off in volume. As a rule, the resolution of all price patterns (the breakout point) should be accompanied by heavier trading activity if the signal given by that breakout is real.
> 
> In a downtrend, the volume should be heavier during down moves and lighter on bounces. As long as that pattern continues, the selling pressure is greater than buying pressure and the downtrend should continue. It’s only when that pattern begins to change that the chartist starts looking for signs of a bottom.
> 
> By monitoring the price and volume together, we’re actually using two different tools to measure the same thing—pressure. By the mere fact that prices are trending higher, we can see that there is more buying than selling pressure. It stands to reason then that the greater volume should take place in the same direction as the prevailing trend. Technicians believe that _volume precedes price_, meaning that the loss of upside pressure in an uptrend or downside pressure in a downtrend actually shows up in the volume figures before it is manifested in a reversal of the price trend.
> 
> ...
> 
> It should be noted that volume reporting in the stock market is much more useful than in the futures markets. Stock trading volume is reported immediately, while it is reported a day late for futures. Levels of upside and downside volume are also available for stocks, but not in futures. The availability of volume data for stocks on each price change during the day has facilitated an even more advanced indicator called Money Flow, developed by Laszlo Birinyi, Jr. This real-time version of OBV tracks the level of volume on each price change in order to determine if money is flowing into or out of a stock. This sophisticated calculation, however, requires a lot of computer power and isn’t readily available to most traders.
> 
> ...
> 
> Let’s summarize some of the more important elements of price, volume, and open interest.
> 
> 1. Volume is used in all markets; open interest mainly in futures.
> 2. Only the total volume and open interest are used for futures.
> 3. Increasing volume (and open interest) indicate that the current price trend will probably continue.
> 4. Declining volume (and open interest) suggest that the price trend may be changing.
> 5. Volume precedes price. Changes in buying or selling pressure are often detected in volume before price.
> 6. On balance volume (OBV), or some variation thereof, can be used to more accurately measure the direction of volume pressure.
> 7. Within an uptrend, a sudden leveling off or decline in open interest often warns of a change in trend. (This applies only to futures.)
> 8. Very high open interest at market tops is dangerous and can intensify downside pressure. (This applies only to futures.)
> 9. A buildup in open interest during consolidation periods intensifies the ensuing breakout. (This applies only to futures.)
> 10. Increases in volume (and open interest) help confirm the resolution of price patterns or any other significant chart developments that signal the beginning of a new trend.

### Chapter 8. Long Term Charts

> The average trader’s dependence on these daily charts, however, and the preoccupation with short term market behavior, cause many to overlook a very useful and rewarding area of price charting—_the use of weekly and monthly charts for longer range trend analysis and forecasting_.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Long range price charts provide a perspective on the market trend that is impossible to achieve with the use of daily charts alone_. During our introduction to the technical philosophy in Chapter 1, it was pointed out that one of the greatest advantages of chart analysis is the application of its principles to virtually any time dimension, including long range forecasting. We also addressed the fallacy, espoused by some, that technical analysis should be limited to short term “timing” with longer range forecasting left to the fundamental analyst.
> 
> ...
> 
> A question often raised concerning long term charts is whether or not historic price levels seen on the charts should be adjusted for inflation. After all, the argument goes, do these long range peaks and troughs have any validity if not adjusted to reflect the changes in the value of the U.S. dollar? This is a point of some controversy among analysts.
> 
> I do not believe that any adjustment is necessary on these long range charts for a number of reasons. The main reason is my belief that the markets themselves have already made the necessary adjustments. A currency declining in value causes commodities quoted in that currency to increase in value. The declining value of the dollar, therefore, would contribute to rising commodity prices. A rising dollar would cause the price of most commodities to fall.
> 
> ...
> 
> The final point in this debate goes to the heart of the technical theory, which states that price action discounts everything, even inflation. All financial markets adjust to periods of inflation and deflation and to changes in currency values. The real answer to whether long range charts should be adjusted for inflation lies in the charts themselves. Many markets fail at historic resistance levels set several years earlier and then bounce off support levels not seen in several years. It’s also clear that falling inflation since the early 1980s has helped support bull markets in bonds and stocks. It would seem that those markets have already made their own inflation adjustment.
> 
> ...
> 
> Long term charts are not meant for trading purposes. A distinction has to be made between market _analysis_ for forecasting purposes and the _timing_ of market commitments. Long term charts are useful in the analytical process to help determine the major trend and price objectives. They are not suitable, however, for the timing of entry and exit points and should not be used for that purpose. For that more sensitive task, daily and intraday charts should be utilized.

### Chapter 9. Moving Averages

> The _moving average_ is one of the most versatile and widely used of all technical indicators. Because of the way it is constructed and the fact that it can be so easily quantified and tested, it is the basis for many mechanical trend-following systems in use today.
> 
> _Chart analysis is largely subjective and difficult to test_. As a result, chart analysis does not lend itself that well to computerization. Moving average rules, by contrast, can easily be programmed into a computer, which then generates specific buy and sell signals. While two technicians may disagree as to whether a given price pattern is a triangle or a wedge, or whether the volume pattern favors the bull or bear side, ***moving average trend signals are precise and not open to debate***.
> 
> Let’s begin by defining what a _moving average_ is. As the second word implies, it is an _average_ of a certain body of data. For example, if a 10 day average of closing prices is desired, the prices for the last 10 days are added up and the total is divided by 10. The term _moving_ is used because only the latest 10 days’ prices are used in the calculation. Therefore, the body of data to be averaged (the last 10 closing prices) moves forward with each new trading day. The most common way to calculate the moving average is to work from the total of the last 10 days’ closing prices. Each day the new close is added to the total and the close 11 days back is subtracted. The new total is then divided by the number of days (10).
> 
> The _moving average_ is essentially a trend following device. Its purpose is to identify or signal that a new trend has begun or that an old trend has ended or reversed. Its purpose is to track the progress of the trend. It might be viewed as a curving trendline. It does not, however, predict market action in the same sense that standard chart analysis attempts to do. ***The moving average is a follower, not a leader***. It never anticipates; it only reacts. The moving average follows a market and tells us that a trend has begun, but only after the fact.
> 
> ... Shorter term averages are more sensitive to the price action, whereas longer range averages are less sensitive. In certain types of markets, it is more advantageous to use a shorter average and, at other times, a longer and less sensitive average proves more useful.
> 
> ![Moving Averages: 20 vs 200 day](/.attachments/moving.averages-20.vs.200-day.png)
> 
> _A comparison of a 20 day and a 200 day moving average. During the sideways period from August to January, prices crossed the shorter average several times. However, they remained above the 200 day average throughout the entire period._
> 
> We have been using the closing price in all of our examples so far. However, while the closing price is considered to be the most important price of the trading day and the price most commonly used in moving average construction, the reader should be aware that some technicians prefer to use other prices. Some prefer to use a midpoint value, which is arrived at by dividing the day’s range by two.
> 
> Others include the closing price in their calculation by adding the high, low, and closing prices together and dividing the sum by three. Still others prefer to construct price bands by averaging the high and low prices separately. The result is two separate moving average lines that act as a sort of volatility buffer or neutral zone. Despite these variations, the closing price is still the price most commonly used for moving average analysis and is the price that we’ll be focusing most of our attention on in this chapter.
> 
> **The Simple Moving Average**
> 
> The _simple moving average_, or the arithmetic mean, is the type used by most technical analysts. But there are some who question its usefulness on two points. The first criticism is that only the period covered by the average (the last 10 days, for example) is taken into account. The second criticism is that the simple moving average gives equal weight to each day’s price. In a 10 day average, the last day receives the same weight as the first day in the calculation. Each day’s price is assigned a 10% weighting. In a 5 day average, each day would have an equal 20% weighting. Some analysts believe that a heavier weighting should be given to the more recent price action.
> 
> **The Linearly Weighted Moving Average**
> 
> In an attempt to correct the weighting problem, some analysts employ a _linearly weighted moving average_. In this calculation, the closing price of the 10th day (in the case of a 10 day average) would be multiplied by 10, the ninth day by nine, the eighth day by eight, and so on. The greater weight is therefore given to the more recent closings. The total is then divided by the sum of the multipliers (55 in the case of the 10 day average: 10 + 9 + 8 +…+ 1). However, the linearly weighted average still does not address the problem of including only the price action covered by the length of the average itself.
> 
> **The Exponentially Smoothed Moving Average**
> 
> This type of average addresses both of the problems associated with the simple moving average. First, the exponentially smoothed average assigns a greater weight to the more recent data. Therefore, it is a weighted moving average. But while it assigns lesser importance to past price data, it does include in its calculation all of the data in the life of the instrument. In addition, the user is able to adjust the weighting to give greater or lesser weight to the most recent day’s price. This is done by assigning a percentage value to the last day’s price, which is added to a percentage of the previous day’s value. The sum of both percentage values adds up to 100. For example, the last day’s price could be assigned a value of 10% (.10), which is added to the previous day’s value of 90% (.90). That gives the last day 10% of the total weighting. That would be the equivalent of a 20 day average. By giving the last day’s price a smaller value of 5% (.05), lesser weight is given to the last day’s data and the average is less sensitive. That would be the equivalent of a 40 day moving average.
> 
> ...
> 
> The simple moving average is the one most commonly used by technicians, and is the one that we’ll be concentrating on. Some traders use just one moving average to generate trend signals. The moving average is plotted on the bar chart in its appropriate trading day along with that day’s price action. ***When the closing price moves above the moving average, a buy signal is generated. A sell signal is given when prices move below the moving average.*** For added confirmation, some technicians also like to see the moving average line itself turn in the direction of the price crossing.
> 
> If a very short term average is employed (a 5 or 10 day), the average tracks prices very closely and several crossings occur. This action can be either good or bad. The use of a very sensitive average produces more trades (with higher commission costs) and results in many false signals (whipsaws). If the average is too sensitive, some of the short term random price movement (or “noise”) activates bad trend signals.

> 
> While the shorter average generates more false signals, it has the advantage of giving trend signals earlier in the move. It stands to reason that the more sensitive the average, the earlier the signals will be. So there is a tradeoff at work here. The trick is to find the average that is sensitive enough to generate early signals, but insensitive enough to avoid most of the random “noise.”

> This technique is called the _double crossover method_. This means that a buy signal is produced when the shorter average crosses above the longer. For example, two popular combinations are the 5 and 20 day averages and the 10 and 50 day averages. In the former, a buy signal occurs when the 5 day average crosses above the 20, and a sell signal when the 5 day moves below the 20. In the latter example, the 10 day crossing above the 50 signals an uptrend, and a downtrend takes place with the 10 slipping under the 50. This technique of using two averages together lags the market a bit more than the use of a single average but produces fewer whipsaws.

> A buying alert takes place in a downtrend when the 4 day crosses above both the 9 and the 18. A confirmed buy signal occurs when the 9 day then crosses above the 18. This places the 4 day over the 9 day which is over the 18 day. Some intermingling may occur during corrections or consolidations, but the general uptrend remains intact. Some traders may take profits during the intermingling process and some may use it as a buying opportunity. There is obviously a lot of room for flexibility here in applying the rules, depending on how aggressively one wants to trade.

> _Percentage envelopes_ can be used to help determine when a market has gotten overextended in either direction. In other words, they tell us when prices have strayed too far from their moving average line. In order to do this, the envelopes are placed at fixed percentages above and below the average. Shorter term traders, for example, often use 3% envelopes around a simple 21 day moving average. When prices reach one of the envelopes (3% from the average), the short term trend is considered to be overextended. For long range analysis, some possible combinations include 5% envelopes around a 10 week average or a 10% envelope around a 40 week average.

> 
> ...
> 
> This technique was developed by John Bollinger. Two trading bands are placed around a moving average similar to the envelope technique. Except that _Bollinger Bands_ are placed two standard deviations above and below the moving average, which is usually 20 days. _Standard deviation_ is a statistical concept that describes how prices are dispersed around an average value. Using two standard deviations ensures that 95% of the price data will fall between the two trading bands. As a rule, prices are considered to be overextended on the upside (overbought) when they touch the upper band. They are considered overextended on the downside (oversold) when they touch the lower band.

> 
> ...
> 
> The simplest way to use Bollinger Bands is to use the upper and lower bands as price targets. In other words, if prices bounce off the lower band and cross above the 20 day average, the upper band becomes the upper price target. A crossing below the 20 day average would identify the lower band as the downside target. In a strong uptrend, prices will usually fluctuate between the upper band and the 20 day average. In that case, a crossing below the 20 day average warns of a trend reversal to the downside.
> 
> Bollinger Bands differ from envelopes in one major way. Whereas the envelopes stay a constant percentage width apart, Bollinger Bands expand and contract based on the last 20 days’ volatility. During a period of rising price volatility, the distance between the two bands will widen. Conversely, during a period of low market volatility, the distance between the two bands will contract. There is a tendency for the bands to alternate between expansion and contraction. When the bands are unusually far apart, that is often a sign that the current trend may be ending. When the distance between the two bands has narrowed too far, that is often a sign that a market may be about to initiate a new trend. Bollinger Bands can also be applied to weekly and monthly price charts by using _20 weeks_ and _20 months_ instead of _20 days_. Bollinger Bands work best when combined with overbought/oversold oscillators that are explained in the next chapter.

### Chapter 10. Oscillators and Contrary Opinion

> The oscillator is only a secondary indicator in the sense that it must be subordinated to basic trend analysis. As we go through the various types of oscillators used by technicians, the importance of trading in the direction of the overriding market trend will be constantly stressed. The reader should also be aware that there are times when oscillators are more useful than at others. For example, near the beginning of important moves, oscillator analysis isn’t that helpful and can even be misleading. Toward the end of market moves, however, oscillators become extremely valuable.
> 
> ... The oscillator band is basically flat while prices may be trading up, down, or sideways. However, the peaks and troughs in the oscillator coincide with the peaks and troughs on the price chart. Some oscillators have a midpoint value that divides the horizontal range into two halves, an upper and a lower. Depending on the formula used, this midpoint line is usually a _zero line_. Some oscillators also have upper and lower boundaries ranging from 0 to 100.
> 
> ...
> 
> There are three situations when the oscillator is most useful. You’ll see that these three situations are common to most types of oscillators that are used.
> 
> 1. The oscillator is most useful when its value reaches an extreme reading near the upper or lower end of its boundaries. The market is said to be _overbought_ when it is near the upper extreme and _oversold_ when it is near the lower extreme. This warns that the price trend is overextended and vulnerable.
> 
> 2. A divergence between the oscillator and the price action when the oscillator is in an extreme position is usually an important warning.
> 
> 3. The crossing of the zero (or midpoint) line can give important trading signals in the direction of the price trend.
> 
> ![Oscillators: 10 Day Momentum](/.attachments/oscillators.10.day.momentum.png)
> 
> _The 10 day momentum line fluctuates around a zero line. Readings too far above the zero line are overbought, while values too far below the line are oversold. Momentum should be used in conjunction with the trend of the market._
> 
> The concept of _momentum_ is the most basic application of oscillator analysis. Momentum measures the velocity of price changes as opposed to the actual price levels themselves. Market momentum is measured by continually taking price differences for a fixed time interval. To construct a 10 day momentum line, simply subtract the closing price 10 days ago from the last closing price. This positive or negative value is then plotted around a zero line. The formula for momentum is:
> 
> $M = V - V^x$
> 
> where V is the latest closing price and V x is the closing price x days ago.

> 
> _A comparison of 10 and 40 day momentum lines. The longer version is more helpful in catching major market turns (see circles)._
> 
> If the latest closing price is greater than that of 10 days ago (in other words, prices have moved higher), then a positive value would be plotted above the zero line. If the latest close is below the close 10 days earlier (prices have declined), then a negative value is plotted below the zero line.
> 
> While the 10 day momentum is a commonly used time period for reasons discussed later, any time period can be employed. A shorter time period (such as 5 days) produces a more sensitive line with more pronounced oscillations. A longer number of days (such as 40 days) results in a much smoother line in which the oscillator swings are less volatile.
> 
> ... By plotting price differences for a set period of time, the chartist is studying rates of ascent or descent. If prices are rising and the momentum line is above the zero line and rising, this means the uptrend is accelerating. If the up-slanting momentum line begins to flatten out, this means that the new gains being achieved by the latest closes are the same as the gains 10 days earlier. While prices may still be advancing, the rate of ascent (or the velocity) has leveled off. When the momentum line begins to drop toward the zero line, the uptrend in prices is still in force, but at a decelerating rate. The uptrend is losing momentum.
> 
> ...
> 
> Because of the way it is constructed, the momentum line is always a step ahead of the price movement. It leads the advance or decline in prices, then levels off while the current price trend is still in effect. It then begins to move in the opposite direction as prices begin to level off.
> 
> The momentum chart has a zero line. Many technicians use the crossing of the zero line to generate buy and sell signals. ***A crossing above the zero line would be a buy signal, and a crossing below the zero line, a sell signal***. It should be stressed here again, however, that basic trend analysis is still the overriding consideration. Oscillator analysis should not be used as an excuse to trade against the prevailing market trend. Buy positions should only be taken on crossings above the zero line if the market trend is up. Short positions should be taken on crossings below the zero line only if the price trend is down.
> 
> ![Oscillators: Trendlines](/.attachments/oscillators.trend.lines.png)

> _The trendlines on the momentum chart are broken sooner than those on the price chart. The value of the momentum indicator is that it turns sooner than the market itself, making it a leading indicator._

> _Some traders regard a crossing above the zero line as a buy signal and a crossing below the line as a sell signal (see circles). A moving average is helpful to confirm trend changes. The momentum line peaked before the price (see arrows)._
> 
> **MEASURING RATE OF CHANGE**
> 
> To measure the _rate of change_, a ratio is constructed of the most recent closing price to a price a certain number of days in the past. To construct a 10 day rate of change oscillator, the latest closing price is divided by the close 10 days ago. The formula is as follows:
> 
> $Rate of change = 100 (V/Vx)$
> 
> where V is the latest close and Vx is the closing price x days ago.
> 
> In this case, the 100 line becomes the midpoint line. If the latest price is higher than the price 10 days ago (prices are rising), the resulting rate of change value will be above 100. If the last close is below 10 days ago, the ratio would be below 100.
> 
> ...
> 
> The crossing of the shorter average above or below the longer average registered buy and sell signals, respectively. It was mentioned at that time that these dual moving average combinations could also be used to construct oscillator charts. This can be done by plotting the difference between the two averages as a histogram. These histogram bars appear as a plus or minus value around a centered zero line. This type of oscillator has three uses:
> 
> 1. To help spot divergences.
> 2. To help identify short term variations from the long term trend, when the shorter average moves too far above or below the longer average.
> 3. To pinpoint the crossings of the two moving averages, which occur when the oscillator crosses the zero line.
> 
> The shorter average is divided by the longer. In both cases, however, the shorter average oscillates around the longer average, which is in effect the zero line. If the shorter average is above the longer, the oscillator would be positive. A negative reading would be present if the shorter average were under the longer.
> 
> When the two moving average lines move too far apart, a market extreme is created calling for a pause in the trend. Very often, the trend remains stalled until the shorter average line moves back to the longer. When the shorter line approaches the longer, a critical point is reached. In an uptrend, for example, the shorter line dips back to the longer average, but should bounce off it. This usually represents an ideal buying area. It’s much like the testing of an up trendline. If the shorter average crosses below the longer average, however, a trend reversal is signaled.
>

> _The histogram lines measure the difference between the two moving averages. Crossing above and below the zero line give buy and sell signals (see arrows). Notice that the histogram turns well before the actual signals (see circles)._
> 
> ...
> 
> In a downtrend, a rise in the shorter average to the longer usually represents an ideal selling area unless the longer line is crossed, in which case a trend reversal signal would be registered. The relationships between the two averages can be used, therefore, not only as an excellent trend-following system, but also to help identify short term overbought and oversold conditions.
> 
> ...
> 
> **COMMODITY CHANNEL INDEX**
> 
> It is possible to normalize an oscillator by dividing the values by a constant divisor. In the construction of his Commodity Channel Index (CCI), Donald R. Lambert compares the current price with a moving average over a selected time span—usually 20 days. He then normalizes the oscillator values by using a divisor based on mean deviation. As a result, the CCI fluctuates in a constant range from +100 on the upside to -100 on the downside. Lambert recommended long positions in those markets with values over +100. Markets with CCI values below -100 were candidates for short sales.
> 
> It seems, however, that most chartists use CCI simply as an overbought/oversold oscillator. Used in that fashion readings over +100 are considered overbought and under -100 are oversold. While the Commodity Channel Index was originally developed for commodities, it is also used for trading stock index futures and options like the S&P 100 (OEX). Although 20 days is the common default value for CCI, the user can vary the number to adjust its sensitivity.

> 
> **RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX**
> 
> As Wilder points out, one of the two major problems in constructing a momentum line (using price differences) is the erratic movement often caused by sharp changes in the values being dropped off. A sharp advance or a decline 10 days ago (in the case of a 10 day momentum line) can cause sudden shifts in the momentum line even if the current prices show little change. Some smoothing is therefore necessary to minimize these distortions. The second problem is that there is the need for a constant range for comparison purposes. The RSI formula not only provides the necessary smoothing, but also solves the latter problem by creating a constant vertical range of 0 to 100.
> 
> The term “relative strength,” incidentally, is a misnomer and often causes confusion among those more familiar with that term as it is used in stock market analysis. Relative strength generally means a ratio line comparing two different entities. A ratio of a stock or industry group to the S&P 500 Index is one way of gauging the relative strength of different stocks or industry groups against one objective benchmark. We’ll show you later in the book how useful relative strength or ratio analysis can be. Wilder’s Relative Strength Index doesn’t really measure the relative strength between different entities and, in that sense, the name is somewhat misleading. The RSI, however, does solve the problem of erratic movement and the need for a constant upper and lower boundary. The actual formula is calculated as follows:
> 
> $RSI = 100 - {100 \over 1 + RS}$
> 
> $RS = {\text{Average of x days' up closes} \over \text{Average of x days' down closes} }$
> 
> Fourteen days are used in the calculation; 14 weeks are used for weekly charts. To find the average up value, add the total points gained on up days during the 14 days and divide that total by 14. To find the average down value, add the total number of points lost during the down days and divide that total by 14. Relative strength (RS) is then determined by dividing the _up_ average by the _down_ average. That RS value is then inserted into the formula for RSI. The number of days can be varied by simply changing the value of x.
> 
> Wilder originally employed a 14 day period. _The shorter the time period, the more sensitive the oscillator becomes and the wider its amplitude_. RSI works best when its fluctuations reach the upper and lower extremes. Therefore, if the user is trading on a very short term basis and wants the oscillator swings to be more pronounced, the time period can be shortened. The time period is lengthened to make the oscillator smoother and narrower in amplitude. The amplitude in the 9 day oscillator is therefore greater than the original 14 day. While 9 and 14 day spans are the most common values used, technicians experiment with other periods. Some use shorter lengths, such as 5 or 7 days, to increase the volatility of the RSI line. Others use 21 or 28 days to smooth out the RSI signals.

>

> 
> RSI is plotted on a vertical scale of 0 to 100. Movements above 70 are considered overbought, while an oversold condition would be a move under 30. Because of shifting that takes place in bull and bear markets, the 80 level usually becomes the overbought level in bull markets and the 20 level the oversold level in bear markets.
> 
> “Failure swings,” as Wilder calls them, occur when the RSI is above 70 or under 30. A _top failure swing_ occurs when a peak in the RSI (over 70) fails to exceed a previous peak in an uptrend, followed by a downside break of a previous trough. A _bottom failure swing_ occurs when the RSI is in a downtrend (under 30), fails to set a new low, and then proceeds to exceed a previous peak.

> 
> In my own personal experience with the RSI oscillator, its greatest value lies in failure swings or divergences that occur when the RSI is over 70 or under 30. Let’s clarify another important point on the use of oscillators. ***Any strong trend, either up or down, usually produces an extreme oscillator reading before too long. In such cases, claims that a market is overbought or oversold are usually premature and can lead to an early exit from a profitable trend. In strong uptrends, overbought markets can stay overbought for some time. Just because the oscillator has moved into the upper region is not reason enough to liquidate a long position (or, even worse, short into the strong uptrend)***.
> 
> The first move into the overbought or oversold region is usually just a warning. The signal to pay close attention to is the second move by the oscillator into the danger zone. If the second move fails to confirm the price move into new highs or new lows (forming a double top or bottom on the oscillator), a possible divergence exists. At that point, some defensive action can be taken to protect existing positions. If the oscillator moves in the opposite direction, breaking a previous high or low, then a divergence or failure swing is confirmed.
> 
> The 50 level is the RSI midpoint value, and will often act as support during pullbacks and resistance during bounces. Some traders treat RSI crossings above and below the 50 level as buying and selling signals respectively.

> 
> **STOCHASTICS (K%D)**
> 
> The _Stochastic_ oscillator was popularized by George Lane (president of Investment Educators, Inc., Watseka, IL). It is based on the observation that as prices increase, closing prices tend to be closer to the upper end of the price range. Conversely, in downtrends, the closing price tends to be near the lower end of the range. Two lines are used in the Stochastic Process—the %K line and the %D line. The %D line is the more important and is the one that provides the major signals.
> 
> The intent is to determine where the most recent closing price is in relation to the price range for a chosen time period. Fourteen is the most common period used for this oscillator. To determine the K line, which is the more sensitive of the two, the formula is:

> $\%K = 100 {[{(C - L14)} / {(H14 - L14)}]}$

> where $C$ is the latest close, $L14$ is the lowest low for the last 14 periods, and $H14$ is the highest high for the same 14 periods (14 periods can refer to days, weeks, or months).
> 
> The formula simply measures, on a percentage basis of 0 to 100, where the closing price is in relation to the total price range for a selected time period. A very high reading (over 80) would put the closing price near the top of the range, while a low reading (under 20) near the bottom of the range.
> 
> The second line (%D) is a 3 period moving average of the %K line. This formula produces a version called fast stochastics. By taking another 3 period average of %D, a smoother version called slow stochastics is computed. Most traders use the slow stochastics because of its more reliable signals.
> 
> These formulas produce two lines that oscillate between a vertical scale from 0 to 100. The K line is a faster line, while the D line is a slower line. The major signal to watch for is a divergence between the D line and the price of the underlying market when the D line is in an overbought or oversold area. The upper and lower extremes are the 80 and 20 values.
> 
> A bearish divergence occurs when the D line is over 80 and forms two declining peaks while prices continue to move higher. A bullish divergence is present when the D line is under 20 and forms two rising bottoms while prices continue to move lower. Assuming all of these factors are in place, the actual buy or sell signal is triggered when the faster K line crosses the slower D line.
> 
> There are other refinements in the use of Stochastics, but this explanation covers the more essential points. Despite the higher level of sophistication, the basic oscillator interpretation remains the same. An alert or set-up is present when the %D line is in an extreme area and diverging from the price action. The actual signal takes place when the D line is crossed by the faster K line.
> 
> The Stochastic oscillator can be used on weekly and monthly charts for longer range perspective. It can also be used effectively on intraday charts for shorter term trading.
> 
> One way to combine daily and weekly stochastics is to use weekly signals to determine market direction and daily signals for timing. It’s also a good idea to combine stochastics with RSI.

> 
> Larry Williams %R is based on a similar concept of measuring the latest close in relation to its price range over a given number of days. Today’s close is subtracted from the price high of the range for a given number of days and that difference is divided by the total range for the same period. The concepts already discussed for oscillator interpretation are applied to %R as well, with the main factors being the presence of divergences in overbought or oversold areas. Since %R is subtracted from the high, it looks like an upside down stochastics. To correct that, charting packages plot an inverted version of %R.

> 
> Oscillator lengths can be tied to underlying market cycles. A time period of 1/2 the cycle length is used. Popular time inputs are 5, 10, and 20 days based on calendar day periods of 14, 28, and 56 days. Wilder’s RSI uses 14 days, which is half of 28. In the previous chapter, we discussed some reasons why the numbers 5, 10, and 20 keep cropping up in moving average and oscillator formulations, so we won’t repeat them here. Suffice it to mention here that 28 calendar days (20 trading days) represent an important dominant monthly trading cycle and that the other numbers are related harmonically to that monthly cycle. The popularity of the 10 day momentum and the 14 day RSI lengths are based largely on the 28 day trading cycle and measure 1/2 of the value of that dominant trading cycle.

However, the reader is cautioned against placing too much importance on divergence analysis to the point where basic trend analysis is either ignored or overlooked.

The place to start your market analysis is always by determining the general trend of the market. If the trend is up, then a buying strategy is called for. Oscillators can then be used to help time market entry. ***Buy when the market is oversold in an uptrend. Sell short when the market is overbought in a downtrend***. Or, buy when the momentum oscillator crosses back above the zero line when the major trend is bullish and sell a crossing under the zero line in a bear market.
> 
> The importance of trading in the direction of the major trend cannot be overstated. The danger in placing too much importance on oscillators by themselves is the temptation to use divergence as an excuse to initiate trades contrary to the general trend. This action generally proves a costly and painful exercise. The oscillator, as useful as it is, is just one tool among many others and must always be used as an aid, not a substitute, for basic trend analysis.
> 
> There are times when oscillators are more useful than at others. ***During choppy market periods, as prices move sideways for several weeks or months, oscillators track the price movement very closely***. The peaks and troughs on the price chart coincide almost exactly with the peaks and troughs on the oscillator. Because both price and oscillator are moving sideways, they look very much alike. At some point, however, a price breakout occurs and a new uptrend or downtrend begins. By its very nature, the oscillator is already in an extreme position just as the breakout is taking place. If the breakout is to the upside, the oscillator is already overbought. An oversold reading usually accompanies a downside breakout. The trader is faced with a dilemma. Should he or she buy the bullish breakout in the face of an overbought oscillator reading? Should the downside breakout be sold into an oversold market?
> 
> In such cases, the oscillator is best ignored for the time being and the position taken. The reason for this is that in the early stages of a new trend, following an important breakout, oscillators often reach extremes very quickly and stay there for awhile. Basic trend analysis should be the main consideration at such times, with oscillators given a lesser role. Later on, as the trend begins to mature, the oscillator should be given greater weight. Many dynamic bull moves have been missed by traders who saw the major trend signal, but decided to wait for their oscillators to move into an oversold condition before buying. To summarize, ***give less attention to the oscillator in the early stages of an important move, but pay close attention to its signals as the move reaches maturity***.
> 
> **MOVING AVERAGE CONVERGENCE/DIVERGENCE**
> 
> We mentioned in the previous chapter an oscillator technique that uses 2 exponential moving averages and here it is. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator, or simply MACD, was developed by Gerald Appel. What makes this indicator so useful is that it combines some of the oscillator principles we’ve already explained with a dual moving average crossover approach. You’ll see only two lines on your computer screen although three lines are actually used in its calculation. The faster line (called the MACD line) is the difference between two exponentially smoothed moving averages of closing prices (usually the last 12 and 26 days or weeks). The slower line (called the signal line) is usually a 9 period exponentially smoothed average of the MACD line. Appel originally recommended one set of numbers for buy signals and another for sell signals. Most traders, however, utilize the default values of 12, 26, and 9 in all instances. That would include daily and weekly values.
> 
> ![Oscillators: MACD](/.attachments/oscillators.macd.png)
> 
> _The Moving Average Convergence Divergence system shows two lines. A signal is given when the faster MACD line crosses the slower signal line. The arrows show five trading signals on this chart of the Nasdaq Composite Index._
> 
> The actual buy and sell signals are given when the two lines cross. A crossing by the faster MACD line above the slower signal line is a buy signal. A crossing by the faster line below the slower is a sell signal. In that sense, MACD resembles a dual moving average crossover method. However, the MACD values also fluctuate above and below a zero line. That’s where it begins to resemble an oscillator. An overbought condition is present when the lines are too far above the zero line. An oversold condition is present when the lines are too far below the zero line. The best buy signals are given when prices are well below the zero line (oversold). Crossings above and below the zero line are another way to generate buy and sell signals respectively, similar to the momentum technique we discussed previously.
> 
> Divergences appear between the trend of the MACD lines and the price line. A negative, or bearish, divergence exists when the MACD lines are well above the zero line (overbought) and start to weaken while prices continue to trend higher. That is often a warning of a market top. A positive, or bullish, divergence exists when the MACD lines are well below the zero line (oversold) and start to move up ahead of the price line. That is often an early sign of a market bottom. Simple trendlines can be drawn on the MACD lines to help identify important trend changes.
> 
> ![Oscillators: MACD Line](/.attachments/oscillators.macd.line.png)
> 
> _The MACD lines fluctuate around a zero line, giving it the quality of an oscillator. The best buy signals occur below the zero line. The best sell signals come from above. Notice the negative divergence given in October (see down arrow)._
> 
> ...
> 
> As with all technical indicators, signals on weekly charts are always more important than those on daily charts. ***The best way to combine them is to use weekly signals to determine market direction and the daily signals to fine-tune entry and exit points. A daily signal is followed only when it agrees with the weekly signal***. Used in that fashion, the weekly signals become trend filters for daily signals. That prevents using daily signals to trade against the prevailing trend. Two crossover systems in which this principle is especially true are MACD and Stochastics.
> 
> ![Oscillators: MACD Histogram Weekly](/.attachments/oscillators.macd.histogram.daily.weekly.png)
> 
> _The MACD histogram works well on weekly charts. At the middle peak, the histogram turned down 10 weeks before the sell signal (down arrow). At the two upturns, the histogram turned up 2 and 4 weeks before the buy signals (up arrows)._

> 
> **THE PRINCIPLE OF CONTRARY OPINION ...**
> 
> ... ***Contrary Opinion, although it is generally listed under the category of technical analysis, is more aptly described as a form of psychological analysis***. ...
> 
> The principle of _Contrary Opinion_ holds that when the vast majority of people agree on anything, they are generally wrong. A true contrarian, therefore, will first try to determine what the majority are doing and then will act in the opposite direction.
> 
> ...
> 
> Consider the case of an individual speculator. Assume that speculator reads his or her favorite newsletter and becomes convinced that a market is about to move substantially higher. The more bullish the forecast, the more aggressively that trader will approach the market. Once that individual speculator’s funds are fully committed to that particular market, however, he or she is overbought—meaning there are no more funds to commit to the market.
>
> Expanding this situation to include all market participants, ***if 80-90% of market traders are bullish on a market, it is assumed that they have already taken their market positions. Who is left to buy and push the market higher?*** This then is one of the keys to understanding Contrary Opinion. If the overwhelming sentiment of market traders is on one side of the market, there simply isn’t enough buying or selling pressure left to continue the present trend.
> 
> ...
> 
> Let’s consider a few additional points that should be kept in mind when using these numbers. The norm or equilibrium point is at 55%. This allows for a built-in bullish bias on the part of the general public. The upper extreme is considered to be 90% and the lower extreme, 20%. Here again, the numbers are shifted upward slightly to allow for the bullish bias.
> 
> A contrarian position can usually be considered when the bullish consensus numbers are above 90% or under 20%. Readings over 75% or under 25% are also considered warning zones and suggest that a turn may be near. However, it is generally advisable to await a change in the trend of the numbers before taking action against the trend. A change in the direction of the Bullish Consensus numbers, especially if it occurs from one of the danger zones, should be watched closely.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Contrary Opinion works better when most of the open interest is held by speculators, who are considered to be weaker hands. It is not advisable to trade against large hedging interests.
> 
> ***Watch the market’s reaction to fundamental news very closely. The failure of prices to react to bullish news in an overbought area is a clear warning that a turn may be near.*** The first adverse news is usually enough to quickly push prices in the other direction. Correspondingly, the failure of prices in an oversold area (under 25%) to react to bearish news can be taken as a warning that all the bad news has been fully discounted in the current low price. Any bullish news will push prices higher.
> 
> As a general rule, trade in the same direction as the trend of the consensus numbers until an extreme is reached, at which time the numbers should be monitored for a sign of a change in trend. It goes without saying that standard technical analytical tools can and should also be employed to help identify market turns at these critical times. The breaking of support or resistance levels, trendlines, or moving averages can be utilized to help confirm that the trend is in fact turning. Divergences on oscillator charts are especially useful when the Bullish Consensus numbers are overbought or oversold.
> 
> **INVESTOR SENTIMENT READINGS**
> 
> Each weekend _Barron’s_ includes in its Market Laboratory section a set of numbers under the heading “Investor Sentiment Readings.” In that space, four different investor polls are included to gauge the degree of bullishness and bearishness in the stock market. The figures are given for the latest week and the period two and three weeks back for comparison purposes. Here’s a random sample of what the latest week’s figures might look like. Remember that these numbers are contrary indicators. ***Too much bullishness is bad. Too much bearishness is good.***

### Chapter 11. Point and Figure Charting

> _The point and figure chart is a study of pure price movement_. That is to say, it does not take time into consideration while plotting the price action. A bar chart, by contrast, combines both price and time. Because of the way the bar chart is constructed, the vertical axis is the price scale and the horizontal axis, a time scale. On a daily chart, for example, each successive day’s price action moves one space or bar to the right. This happens even if prices saw little or no change for that day. Something must always be placed in the next space. On the point and figure chart, only the price changes are recorded. If no price change occurs, the chart is left untouched. During active market periods, a considerable amount of plotting may be required. During quiet market conditions, little or no plotting will be needed.
> 
> An important difference is the treatment of volume. Bar charts record volume bars under the day’s price action. Point and figure charts ignore volume numbers, as a separate entity. This last phrase, “as a separate entity,” is an important one. Although the volume numbers are not recorded on the point and figure chart, it does not necessarily follow that volume, or trading activity, is totally lost. On the contrary, since intraday point and figure charts record all price change activity, the heavier or lighter volume is reflected in the amount of price changes recorded on the chart. Because volume is one of the more important ingredients in determining the potency of support and resistance levels, point and figure charts become especially useful in determining at which price levels most of the trading activity took place and, hence, where the important support and resistance numbers are.

> 
> _A buy signal is given when one x column rises above the top of a previous x column (see up arrows). A sell signal is given when a column of o’s falls below a previous o column (see down arrows). Signals are more precise on point and figure charts._
> 
> Correspondingly, when a column of o’s declines one box under a previous column of o’s, a downside breakout occurs. Notice how much more precise these breakouts are than those on the bar chart. These breakouts can, of course, be used as buy and sell signals. We’ll have more to say on buy and sell signals a bit later. But the charts demonstrate one of the advantages of the point and figure chart, mainly the greater precision and ease in recognizing trend signals.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Let’s construct an intraday chart using some actual price data.
> 
> The following numbers describe 9 actual days of trading in a Swiss franc futures contract. The box size is 5 points. Therefore, every 5 point swing in either direction is plotted. We’ll start with a 1 box reversal chart.
> 
> Let’s begin on the left side of the chart. First the chart is scaled to reflect a 5 point increment for every box.
> 
> Column 1: Put a dot at 4875. Because the next number—4880—is higher, fill in the next box up to 4880.
> 
> Column 2: The next number is 4860. Move 1 column to the right, go down 1 box, and fill in all the o’s down to 4860.
> 
> Column 3: The next number is 4865. Move 1 column to the right, move up 1 box and put an x at 4865. Stop here. So far you have only 1 x marked in column 3 because prices have only moved up 1 box. On a 1 box reversal chart, there must always be at least 2 boxes filled in each column. Notice that the next number is 4850, calling for o’s down to that number. Do you go to the next column to record the column of declining o’s? The answer is no because that would leave only 1 mark, the x, in column 3. Therefore, in the column with the lone x (column 3) fill in o’s down to 4850.
> 
> Column 4: The next number is 4860. Move to the next column, move 1 box up, and plot in the x’s up to 4860.
> 
> Column 5: The next number is 4855. Because this is a move down, go to the next column, move down a box, and fill the o at 4860. Notice on the table that this is the last price of the day. Let’s do one more.
> 
> Column 6: The first number on 5/2 is 4870. So far, you only have one o in column 5. You must have at least 2 marks in each column. Therefore, fill in x’s (because prices are advancing) up to 4870. But notice that the last price on the previous day is blacked out. This is to help keep track of time. By blacking in the last price each day, it’s much easier to keep track of the separate days’ trading.
> 
> ![Point and Figure: 5 x 1](/.attachments/point.and.figure-5x1.png)
> 
> _A 5×1 point and figure chart of a Deutsche mark contract is shown in the upper chart. The blackened boxes show the end of each day’s trading._
> 
> Feel free to continue through the remainder of the chart to sharpen your understanding of the plotting process. Notice that this chart has several columns where both x’s and o’s are present. This situation will only develop on the 1 point reversal chart and is caused by the necessity of having at least 2 boxes filled in each column. Some purists might argue with combining the x’s and o’s. Experience will show, however, that this method of plotting prices makes it much easier to follow the order of the transactions.
> 
> ...
> 
> One principal advantage of the intraday 1 box reversal chart is the ability to obtain price objectives through use of the _horizontal count_. If you think back to our coverage of bar charts and price patterns, the question of price objectives was discussed. However, virtually all methods of obtaining price objectives off bar charts were based on what we call _vertical measurements_. This meant measuring the height of a pattern (the volatility) and projecting that distance upward or downward. For example, the head and shoulders pattern measured the distance from the head to the neckline and swung that objective from the break of that neckline.
> 
> As you can see, they’re not much different from ones already discussed on bar charting. Most of the patterns are variations on the double and triple tops and bottoms, head and shoulders, V’s and inverted V’s, and saucers. The term “fulcrum” shows up quite a bit in the point and figure literature. Essentially, the fulcrum is a well defined congestion area, occurring after a significant advance or decline, that forms an accumulation base or a distribution top. In a base, for example, the bottom of the area is subjected to repeated tests, interrupted by intermittent rally attempts. Very often, the fulcrum takes on the appearance of a double or triple bottom. The basing pattern is completed when a breakout (catapult) occurs over the top of the congestion area.

> 
> Those reversal patterns with the most pronounced horizontal ranges obviously lend themselves quite well to the taking of count measurements. The V base, in contrast, because of the absence of a significant horizontal price area, would not be amenable to the taking of a horizontal count. The blackened boxes in the chart examples represent suggested buying and selling points. Notice that those entry points generally coincide with the retesting of support areas in a base or resistance areas in a top, breakout points, and the breaking of trendlines.
> 
> Trendline analysis on intraday charts is the same as that applied to bar charts. Up trendlines are drawn under successive lows and down trendlines are drawn over successive peaks. This is not true of the simplified point and figure chart ... It utilizes 45 degree lines and plots them differently.
> 
> ...
> 
> These are your basic up and down trendlines. Because of the severe condensation on these charts, it would be impractical to try to connect rally tops or reaction lows. The 45 degree line is, therefore, used. In an uptrend, _the bullish support line_ is drawn at a _45 degree angle_ upward to the right from under the lowest column of o’s. As long as prices remain above that line, the major trend is considered to be bullish. In a downtrend, the bearish resistance line is drawn at a 45 degree angle downward to the right from the top of the highest column of x’s. As long as prices remain below that down trendline, the trend is bearish.

> _Examples of the Chartcraft three point reversal stock charts. Notice that the trendlines are drawn at 45 degree angles. (Source: Courtesy of Chartcraft, New Rochelle, NY.)_
> 
> At times, those lines may have to be adjusted. For example, sometimes a correction in an uptrend breaks below the rising support line after which the uptrend resumes. In such cases, a new support line must be drawn at a 45 degree angle from the bottom of that reaction low. Sometimes a trend is so strong that the original up trendline is simply too far away from the price action. In that case, a tighter trendline should be drawn in an attempt to arrive at a “best fitting” support line.

> 
> 1. A simple buy signal can be used for the covering of old shorts and/or the initiation of new longs.
> 2. A simple sell signal can be used for the liquidation of old longs and/or the initiation of new shorts.
> 3. The simple signal can be used only for liquidation purposes with a complex formation needed for a new commitment.
> 4. The trendline can be used as a filter. Long positions are taken above the trendline and short positions below the trendline.
> 5. For stop protection, always risk below the last column of o’s in an uptrend and over the last column of x’s in a downtrend.
> 6. The actual entry point can be varied as follows:
>    1. Buy the actual breakout in an uptrend.
>    2. Buy a 3 box reversal after the breakout occurs to obtain a lower entry point.
>    3. Buy a 3 box reversal in the direction of the original breakout after a correction occurs. Not only does this require the added confirmation of a positive reversal in the right direction, but a closer stop point can now be used under the latest column of o’s.
>    4. Buy a second breakout in the same direction as the original breakout signal.
>
> As you can readily see from the list, there are many different ways that the point and figure chart can be used. Once the basic technique is understood, there is almost unlimited flexibility as to how to best enter and exit a market using this approach.
> 
> The actual buy or sell signal occurs on the first signal. However, as the move continues, several other signals appear on the chart. These repeat buy or sell signals can be used for additional positions. Whether or not this is done, the protective stop point can be raised to just below the latest o column in an uptrend and lowered to just over the latest x column in a downtrend. This use of a _trailing_ stop allows the trader to stay with the position and protect accumulated profits at the same time.

In addition, you can vary the box and reversal sizes with a keystroke to adjust the chart for shorter or longer term analysis. You can construct p&f charts from real-time (intraday) and end of day data, and you can apply them to any market you want. But you can do a lot more with a computer.

### Chapter 12. Japanese Candlesticks

> Charting market data in candlestick form uses the same data available for standard bar charts; open, high, low, and close prices. While using the exact same data, candlestick charts offer a much more visually appealing chart. Information seems to jump off the page (computer screen). The information displayed is more easily interpreted and analyzed. The box below is a depiction of of a single day of prices showing the difference between the bar (left) and the candlestick(s).
> 
> ![Candlesticks: The Candlestick](/.attachments/candlesticks-the.candlestick.png)
> 
> You can see how the name “candlesticks” came about. They look somewhat like a candle with a wick. The rectangle represents the difference between the open and close price for the day, and is called the _body_. Notice that the body can be either black or white. A _white body_ means that the close price was greater (higher) than the open price. Actually, the body is not white, but open (not filled), which makes it work better with computers. This is so that it will print correctly when printing charts on a computer. This is one of the adaptations that have occurred in the West; the Japanese use red for the open body. The _black body_ means that the close price was lower than the open price. The open and close prices are given much significance in Japanese candlesticks. The small lines above and below the body are referred to as _wicks_ or _hairs_ or _shadows_. Many different names for these lines appear in Japanese reference literature, which is odd since they represent the high and low prices for the day and are normally not considered vital in the analysis by the Japanese.
> 
> ...
> 
> Different body/shadow combinations have different meanings. Days in which the difference between the open and close prices is great are called _Long Days_. Likewise, days in which the difference between the open and close price is small, are called _Short Days_. Remember, we are only talking about the size of the body and no reference is made to the high and/or low prices.
> 
> ![Candlesticks: Long Days and Short Days](/.attachments/candlesticks-long.days.short.days.png)
> 
> ...
> 
> **CANDLE PATTERN ANALYSIS**
> 
> A Japanese candle pattern is a psychological depiction of traders’ mentality at the time. It vividly shows the actions of the traders as time unfolds in the market. The mere fact that humans react consistently during similar situations makes candle pattern analysis work.
> 
> A Japanese candle pattern can consist of a single candlestick line or be a combination of multiple lines, normally never more than five. While most candle patterns are used to determine reversal points in the market, there are a few that are used to determine trend continuation. They are referred to as reversal and continuation patterns. Whenever a reversal pattern has bullish implications, an inversely related pattern has bearish meaning. Similarly, whenever a continuation pattern has bullish implications, an opposite pattern gives bearish meaning. When there is a pair of patterns that work in both bullish and bearish situations, they usually have the same name. In a few cases, however, the bullish pattern and its bearish counterpart have completely different names.
> 
> ...
> 
> **FILTERED CANDLE PATTERNS**
> 
> A revolutionary concept developed by Greg Morris in 1991, called candle pattern filtering, provides a simple method to improve the overall reliability of candle patterns. While the short term trend of the market must be identified before a candle pattern can exist, determination of overbought and oversold markets using traditional technical analysis will enhance a candle pattern’s predictive ability. Concurrently, this technique helps eliminate bad or premature candle patterns.
> 
> One must first grasp how a traditional technical indicator responds to price data. In this example, Stochastics %D will be used. The stochastic indicator oscillates between 0 and 100, with 20 being oversold and 80 being overbought. The primary interpretation for this indicator is when %D rises above 80 and then falls below 80, a sell signal has been generated. Similarly, when it drops below 20 and then rises above 20, a buy signal is given.
> 
> Here is what we know about stochastics %D: When it enters the area above 80 or below 20, it will eventually generate a signal. In other words, it is just a matter of time until a signal is given. The area above 80 and below 20 is called the presignal area and represents the area that %D must get to before it can give a trading signal of its own.
> 
> ![Candlesticks: Pairing with Stochastic Oscillator](/.attachments/candlesticks-pairing.candlesticks.with.stochastic.oscillator.png)
> 
> The filtered candle pattern concept uses this presignal area. Candle patterns are considered only when %D is in its presignal area. If a candle pattern occurs when stochastics %D is at, say 65, the pattern is ignored. Also, only reversal candle patterns are considered using this concept.
> 
> Candle pattern filtering is not limited to using stochastics %D. Any technical oscillator that you might normally use for analysis can be used to filter candle patterns. Wilder’s RSI, Lambert’s CCI, and Williams’ %R are a few that will work equally as well.


## Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques

### Chapter 1. Introduction

> Year after year the flames of interest grow ever brighter for these charting tools. This is because candle charts:
> 
> - _Are easy to understand_: Anyone, from the first-time chartist to the seasoned professional, can easily harness the power of candle charts. Don’t let the simplicity of these tools fool you. Their power to analyze the health of the market is unmatched by any other charting methodology.
>
> - _Provide earlier indications of market turns_: Candle charts often send out reversal signals well before those of traditional indicators on bar or point and figure charts. This should help you to enter and exit the market with better timing.
>
> - _Furnish unique market insights_: Candle charts not only show the trend of the move, as does a bar chart, but, unlike bar charts, candle charts also show the force underpinning the move.
> 
> - _Are enjoyable to learn_: The picturesque terms such as _dark-cloud covers_, _hammers_, and _windows_ make candle charts fun to use. But don’t let the “picturesque” names fool you. These techniques will be potent weapons in your battle with the markets.
> 
> - _Enhance Western charting analysis_: Candle charts are so versatile, they can be fused with any Western technical tool. For our clients, we merge the insights given by the candle charts with the most potent Western technical analysis tools. If you are a seasoned technician, you will discover how joining Japanese candles with your favorite technical tools can create a powerful synergy of techniques. This merging of Eastern and Western analysis will give you a jump on those who use only traditional Western charting techniques.
> 
> - _Will increase efficiency of your analysis_: Because of the immediate visual information sent out by the candle charts, they will make your market analysis faster and more efficient.
> 
> ...
> 
> Candle charts provide many useful trading signals. They do not, however, provide price targets. This is why it is so important to use Western technical techniques on candle charts.
> 
> ...
> 
> Candles are not designed to be a complete system; they are just one weapon, albeit a powerful one, to use in your trading battles.
> 
> ...
> 
> The importance of technical analysis is multifaceted. First, while fundamental analysis may provide a gauge of the supply/demand situations (i.e., price/earnings ratios, economic statistics) and so forth, there is no psychological component involved in such analysis. Yet the markets are influenced at times, to a major extent, by emotionalism. As John Maynard Keynes stated, “There is nothing so disastrous as a rational investment policy in an irrational world.”? Technical analysis provides the only mechanism to measure the “irrational” (emotional) component present in all markets.
> 
> ...
> 
> Discipline helps mitigate the nemesis of all traders, namely, emotion. As soon as you have money in the market, emotionalism is in the driver’s seat and rationale and objectivity are merely passengers. If you doubt this, try paper trading. Then try trading with your own funds. You will soon discover how deeply the counterproductive aspects of tension, anticipation, and anxiety alter the way you trade and view the markets—usually in proportion to the funds committed. Technicals can put objectivity back into the driver’s seat. They provide a mechanism to set entry and exit points, to set risk/reward ratios, or stop out levels. By using them, you foster a risk and money management approach to trading.
> 
> ...
> 
> Fourth, random walk proffers that the market price for one day has no bearing on the price the following day. But this academic view leaves out an important component—people. People remember prices from one day to the next and act accordingly. To wit, people’s reactions indeed affect price, but price also affects people’s reactions. Thus, price, itself, is an important component in market analysis. Those who disparage technical analysis forget this last point.
> 
> Fifth, the price action is the most direct and easily accessible method of seeing overall supply/demand relationships. There may be fundamental news not known to the general public, but you can expect it is already in the price. Those who have advance knowledge of some market-moving event will most likely buy or sell until current prices reflect their information.

### Chapter 3. Constructing the Candlestick Lines

> ![Bar Chart vs. Candle Chart](/.attachments/bar.chart.vs.candle.chart.png)
> 
> The rectangular sections of the candle lines are called the real body. The real body represents the range between the session’s open and close. When the real body is black (i.e., filled), it means the close of the session was lower than the open. If the real body is white (i.e., empty), it shows the close was higher than the open.
> 
> The thin lines above and below the real body are the shadows (these names are almost lyrical—the real body and the shadows of these real bodies.) These shadows represent the session’s price extremes. The shadow above the real body is called the upper shadow and the shadow below the real body is the lower shadow. Accordingly, the peak of the upper shadow is the high of the session and the bottom of the lower shadow is the low of the session.
> 
> ...
> 
> The Japanese say the real body is “the essence of the price movement.” This reflects a central concept about the power of the real bodies: By looking at the height and color of the real body, we get an immediate visual clue whether it’s the bulls or bears who are in control.

In trading, a candlestick represents the price movement of an asset within a specific timeframe, commonly used in technical analysis. The high and low points of a candlestick provide crucial information:

1. **High:** The topmost point of the vertical line (wick) represents the highest price reached for that asset within the chosen timeframe (e.g., a day, an hour, etc.). It signifies the highest price buyers were willing to pay during that period.

2. **Low:** The bottom of the vertical line (wick) indicates the lowest price reached for the asset within the same timeframe. It reflects the lowest price at which sellers were willing to sell during that period.

The open and close on a candlestick represent the prices at which an asset began and ended within a specific timeframe, such as a day, hour, or minute.

- **Open:** The open price is depicted by the start of the candlestick's body. It signifies the price at which the asset started trading at the beginning of the selected timeframe.

- **Close:** The close price is represented by the end of the candlestick's body. It shows the price at which the asset concluded trading at the end of the selected timeframe.

The color of the candlestick (often green or red) depends on whether the closing price was higher or lower than the opening price:

- **Green/White Candle:** The closing price is higher than the opening price, indicating a net price increase during that timeframe.
  
- **Red/Black Candle:** The closing price is lower than the opening price, signifying a net price decrease during that timeframe.

The body of the candlestick illustrates the price range between the open and close. If the close is higher than the open, the body is typically hollow or filled in, representing an uptrend. Conversely, if the close is lower than the open, the body is usually filled or colored, indicating a downtrend.

Understanding the open and close prices assists traders in gauging market sentiment, price direction, and potential trend reversals.

### Chapter 4. Reversal Patterns

![Candlestick Cheet Sheet](/.attachments/candlestick.cheat.sheet.webp)

> Technicians watch for price clues alerting them to a shift in market psychology and trend. Reversal patterns are these technical clues. Western reversal indicators include double tops and bottoms, reversal days, head and shoulders, and island tops and bottoms. Yet the term “reversal pattern” is somewhat of a misnomer. Hearing that term may lead you to think of an old trend ending abruptly and then reversing to a new trend. This rarely happens. Trend changes usually occur slowly, in stages, as the underlying psychology shifts gears. A trend reversal signal implies that the prior trend is likely to change, but not necessarily reversing. Compare a trend to a car traveling forward. The car’s red brake lights go on and the car stops. The brake light was the reversal indicator showing that the prior trend (that is, the car moving forward) was about to end. But now that the car is stationary, will the driver then decide to put the car in reverse? Will he or she remain stopped? Will he or she decide to go forward again?

#### UMBRELLA LINES
 
> Umbrella lines are candles with very long lower shadows and a small real body at the top end of the range. These umbrella lines are fascinating in that these lines can be either bullish or bearish according to the market environment.
> 
> If an umbrella line emerges during a downtrend, it is a signal that the downtrend should end. In such a scenario, this umbrella line is labeled a _hammer_, as in “the market is hammering out” a base. The actual Japanese word for the hammer is takuri. This word means “trying to gauge the depth of the water by feeling for its bottom.” This is a perfect analogy for the hammer line as the market attempts to grope for a bottom. Coincidently, the hammer line looks likes a hammer with its head and handle.
> 
> As mentioned above, the character of umbrella lines changes based on the prevailing trend before the umbrella line. We saw that an umbrella line after a decline is a bullish signal called a hammer. However, if either of the "umbrella" emerges after a rally, it is a potential top reversal signal ominously called _a hanging man_. The name “hanging man” is derived from the fact that it looks like a hanging man with dangling legs.

#### THE ENGULFING PATTERN

> ... Most candle signals, ..., are based on combinations of individual candle lines. The engulfing pattern is the first of these multiple candle line patterns. The engulfing pattern is a major reversal signal with two opposite color real bodies composing this pattern.
> 
> ![Bullish Engulfing Pattern](/.attachments/bullish.engulfing.pattern.png)
> 
> _Bullish Engulfing Pattern_
> 
> When a white bullish real body wraps around, or _engulfs_, the prior period's black real body, it is indication of a _bullish engulfing pattern_. Another nickname is a "hugging line" for obvious reasons. This shows buying pressure has overwhelmed selling pressure.
> 
> ![Bearish Engulfing Patter](/.attachments/bearish.engulfing.pattern.png)
> 
> _Bearish Engulfing Pattern_
> 
> When a black real body wraps around, or _engulfs_, the prior period's white real body, it is indication of a _bearish engulfing pattern_. It is the signal of a top reversal. This shows that supply has overwhelmed demand.
> 
> There are three criteria for an engulfing pattern:
>
> 1. The market has to be in a clearly definable uptrend (for a bearish engulfing pattern) or downtrend (for a bullish engulfing pattern), even if the trend is short term.
> 
> 2. Two candles comprise the engulfing pattern. The second real body must engulf the prior real body (it need not engulf the shadows).
> 
> 3. The second real body of the engulfing pattern should be the opposite color of the first real body. (The exception to this rule is if the first real body of the engulfing pattern is a doji. Thus, after an extended fall, a doji engulfed by a very large white real body could be a bottom reversal. In an uptrend, a doji enveloped by a very large black real body could be a bearish reversal pattern).
> 
> ...
> 
> Some factors increasing the likelihood that an engulfing pattern could be an important turning signal are:
> 
> 1. If the first day of the engulfing pattern has a very small real body (i.e., a spinning top) and the second day has a very long real body. The small first real body candle reflects a dissipation of the prior trend’s force and the large second real body proves an increase in force behind the new move.
> 
> 2. If the engulfing pattern appears after a protracted or very fast move. A fast or extended move creates an overextended market (either overbought or oversold) and makes it vulnerable to profit taking.
> 
> 3. If there is heavy volume on the second real body of the engulfing pattern.

#### DARK-CLOUD COVER

> ![Dark Cloud Cover](/.attachments/dark.cloud.cover.png)
> 
> _Dark-Cloud Cover_
> 
> Our next reversal pattern is the _dark-cloud cover_. It is a dual-candle pattern that is a top reversal after an uptrend or, at times, at the top of a congestion band. The first day of this two-candle patter is a strong white real body. The second day's price opens above the prior's session's high (that is, above the top of the upper shadow). However, by the end of the second day's session, the market closes deeply within the prior day's white body. The greater degree of penetration into the white body, the more likely this is a top. Some Japanese technicians require more than a 50-percent penetration of the black session's close into the white real body. If the black candle does not close below the halfway point of the white candlestick, it may be best to wait for more bearish confirmation following the dark-cloud cover. In some circumstances it can be viewed as a dark-cloud cover even if the open is over the prior session's close instead of the prior session's high.
