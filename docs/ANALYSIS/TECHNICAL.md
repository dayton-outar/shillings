### Indicators and Tools for Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is a method used by traders and investors to evaluate and predict future price movements in financial markets. It involves the use of various tools and indicators to make informed decisions. Here's a list of some common tools and indicators used in technical analysis:

1. **Candlestick Charts**: Candlestick charts display price movements over a specified time period, providing information on open, high, low, and close prices.

2. **Moving Averages (MAs)**: These include Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) that help smooth out price data over a specified period, revealing trends.

3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: RSI measures the speed and change of price movements, helping identify overbought or oversold conditions.

4. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages.

5. **Bollinger Bands**: Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band (SMA) and upper and lower bands that help identify volatility and potential reversal points.

6. **Stochastic Oscillator**: It compares the current price to its price range over a specified period, identifying overbought or oversold conditions.

7. **Fibonacci Retracement**: Based on the Fibonacci sequence, this tool is used to identify potential support and resistance levels.

8. **Ichimoku Cloud**: This indicator offers information about support and resistance levels, as well as the overall market trend.

9. **Volume Analysis**: Volume indicators like On-Balance Volume (OBV) can help confirm trends by analyzing trading volumes.

10. **Chart Patterns**: These include common patterns like head and shoulders, double tops and bottoms, flags, and triangles that can signal potential price movements.

11. **Support and Resistance Levels**: Identifying key price levels where assets tend to find support or resistance.

12. **Parabolic SAR**: The Parabolic Stop and Reverse indicator helps traders identify potential entry and exit points.

13. **Average True Range (ATR)**: ATR measures market volatility by calculating the average range between the daily high and low.

14. **Elliott Wave Theory**: A more complex method that seeks to identify patterns in price movements based on a wave theory.

15. **Pivot Points**: These levels indicate potential support and resistance levels based on the previous day's price action.

16. **Williams %R**: This oscillator helps identify overbought or oversold conditions and potential reversals.

17. **Market Sentiment Indicators**: These can include the put-call ratio and the VIX (Volatility Index) to gauge market sentiment.

18. **Candlestick Patterns**: Specific candlestick formations like doji, hammers, and shooting stars can provide insights into market sentiment.

19. **Gaps**: Price gaps on charts can indicate significant price movements and potential areas of support or resistance.

20. **Hull Moving Average**: A more responsive moving average that aims to reduce lag.

These are just some of the many tools and indicators used in technical analysis. Traders often combine multiple indicators to make more informed trading decisions. Keep in mind that technical analysis is not a guaranteed method for predicting market movements, and it's important to use it in conjunction with other forms of analysis and risk management.

### Chapter 6. Understand Technical Analysis I

> While it is hard to assess the forecasting value of technical analysis, there is another simple reason that using technical analysis is inherently risky (assuming you are a human being). Humans are designed to see patterns. It’s how our biology works. It allows us to simplify and process a complex world. _It is called apophenia: the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns within random data._

That is the fat part that is black and white (some systems use green and red in place of black and white).

So, to recap, the body is the open to close range, the color defines if the currency pair rose or fell, and the shadows (sometimes called wicks, as in candle wicks) are the intraday extension outside the open-to-close range.

## Chapter 1. Introduction

> Year after year the flames of interest grow ever brighter for these charting tools. This is because candle charts:
> 
> - _Are easy to understand_: Anyone, from the first-time chartist to the seasoned professional, can easily harness the power of candle charts. Don’t let the simplicity of these tools fool you. Their power to analyze the health of the market is unmatched by any other charting methodology.
>
> - _Provide earlier indications of market turns_: Candle charts often send out reversal signals well before those of traditional indicators on bar or point and figure charts. This should help you to enter and exit the market with better timing.
>
> - _Furnish unique market insights_: Candle charts not only show the trend of the move, as does a bar chart, but, unlike bar charts, candle charts also show the force underpinning the move.
> 
> - _Are enjoyable to learn_: The picturesque terms such as _dark-cloud covers_, _hammers_, and _windows_ make candle charts fun to use. But don’t let the “picturesque” names fool you. These techniques will be potent weapons in your battle with the markets.
> 
> - _Enhance Western charting analysis_: Candle charts are so versatile, they can be fused with any Western technical tool. For our clients, we merge the insights given by the candle charts with the most potent Western technical analysis tools. If you are a seasoned technician, you will discover how joining Japanese candles with your favorite technical tools can create a powerful synergy of techniques. This merging of Eastern and Western analysis will give you a jump on those who use only traditional Western charting techniques.
> 
> - _Will increase efficiency of your analysis_: Because of the immediate visual information sent out by the candle charts, they will make your market analysis faster and more efficient.
> 
> ...
> 
> Candle charts provide many useful trading signals. They do not, however, provide price targets. This is why it is so important to use Western technical techniques on candle charts.
> 
> ...
> 
> Candles are not designed to be a complete system; they are just one weapon, albeit a powerful one, to use in your trading battles.

> The importance of technical analysis is multifaceted. First, while fundamental analysis may provide a gauge of the supply/demand situations (i.e., price/earnings ratios, economic statistics) and so forth, there is no psychological component involved in such analysis. Yet the markets are influenced at times, to a major extent, by emotionalism. As John Maynard Keynes stated, “There is nothing so disastrous as a rational investment policy in an irrational world.”? Technical analysis provides the only mechanism to measure the “irrational” (emotional) component present in all markets.
> 
> ...
> 
> Discipline helps mitigate the nemesis of all traders, namely, emotion. As soon as you have money in the market, emotionalism is in the driver’s seat and rationale and objectivity are merely passengers. If you doubt this, try paper trading. Then try trading with your own funds. You will soon discover how deeply the counterproductive aspects of tension, anticipation, and anxiety alter the way you trade and view the markets—usually in proportion to the funds committed. Technicals can put objectivity back into the driver’s seat. They provide a mechanism to set entry and exit points, to set risk/reward ratios, or stop out levels. By using them, you foster a risk and money management approach to trading.
> 
> ...
> 
> Fourth, random walk proffers that the market price for one day has no bearing on the price the following day. But this academic view leaves out an important component—people. People remember prices from one day to the next and act accordingly. To wit, people’s reactions indeed affect price, but price also affects people’s reactions. Thus, price, itself, is an important component in market analysis. Those who disparage technical analysis forget this last point.
> 
> Fifth, the price action is the most direct and easily accessible method of seeing overall supply/demand relationships. There may be fundamental news not known to the general public, but you can expect it is already in the price. Those who have advance knowledge of some market-moving event will most likely buy or sell until current prices reflect their information.

## Chapter 3. Constructing the Candlestick Lines

> ![Bar Chart vs. Candle Chart](/.attachments/bar.chart.vs.candle.chart.png)
> 
> The rectangular sections of the candle lines are called the real body. The real body represents the range between the session’s open and close. When the real body is black (i.e., filled), it means the close of the session was lower than the open. If the real body is white (i.e., empty), it shows the close was higher than the open.
> 
> The thin lines above and below the real body are the shadows (these names are almost lyrical—the real body and the shadows of these real bodies.) These shadows represent the session’s price extremes. The shadow above the real body is called the upper shadow and the shadow below the real body is the lower shadow. Accordingly, the peak of the upper shadow is the high of the session and the bottom of the lower shadow is the low of the session.
> 
> ...
> 
> The Japanese say the real body is “the essence of the price movement.” This reflects a central concept about the power of the real bodies: By looking at the height and color of the real body, we get an immediate visual clue whether it’s the bulls or bears who are in control.
