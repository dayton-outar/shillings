# Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is a method used by traders and investors to evaluate and predict future price movements in financial markets. It involves the use of various tools and indicators to make informed decisions. Here's a list of some common tools and indicators used in technical analysis:

1. **Candlestick Charts**: Candlestick charts display price movements over a specified time period, providing information on open, high, low, and close prices.

2. **Moving Averages (MAs)**: These include Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) that help smooth out price data over a specified period, revealing trends.

3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: RSI measures the speed and change of price movements, helping identify overbought or oversold conditions.

4. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages.

5. **Bollinger Bands**: Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band (SMA) and upper and lower bands that help identify volatility and potential reversal points.

6. **Stochastic Oscillator**: It compares the current price to its price range over a specified period, identifying overbought or oversold conditions.

7. **Fibonacci Retracement**: Based on the Fibonacci sequence, this tool is used to identify potential support and resistance levels.

8. **Ichimoku Cloud**: This indicator offers information about support and resistance levels, as well as the overall market trend.

9. **Volume Analysis**: Volume indicators like On-Balance Volume (OBV) can help confirm trends by analyzing trading volumes.

10. **Chart Patterns**: These include common patterns like head and shoulders, double tops and bottoms, flags, and triangles that can signal potential price movements.

11. **Support and Resistance Levels**: Identifying key price levels where assets tend to find support or resistance.

12. **Parabolic SAR**: The Parabolic Stop and Reverse indicator helps traders identify potential entry and exit points.

13. **Average True Range (ATR)**: ATR measures market volatility by calculating the average range between the daily high and low.

14. **Elliott Wave Theory**: A more complex method that seeks to identify patterns in price movements based on a wave theory.

15. **Pivot Points**: These levels indicate potential support and resistance levels based on the previous day's price action.

16. **Williams %R**: This oscillator helps identify overbought or oversold conditions and potential reversals.

17. **Market Sentiment Indicators**: These can include the put-call ratio and the VIX (Volatility Index) to gauge market sentiment.

18. **Candlestick Patterns**: Specific candlestick formations like doji, hammers, and shooting stars can provide insights into market sentiment.

19. **Gaps**: Price gaps on charts can indicate significant price movements and potential areas of support or resistance.

20. **Hull Moving Average**: A more responsive moving average that aims to reduce lag.

These are just some of the many tools and indicators used in technical analysis. Traders often combine multiple indicators to make more informed trading decisions. Keep in mind that technical analysis is not a guaranteed method for predicting market movements, and it's important to use it in conjunction with other forms of analysis and risk management.

### Chapter 6. Understand Technical Analysis I

> While it is hard to assess the forecasting value of technical analysis, there is another simple reason that using technical analysis is inherently risky (assuming you are a human being). Humans are designed to see patterns. It’s how our biology works. It allows us to simplify and process a complex world. _It is called apophenia: the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns within random data._
> 
> ...
> 
> I strongly advise you to learn about technical analysis and use it as a tool—but consider it a risk management and tactical tool, not a trade selection or forecasting tool.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Occam’s Razor states that among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Other, more complicated solutions may ultimately prove correct, but—in the absence of certainty—the fewer assumptions that are made, the better._
> 
> When using technical analysis as a risk management and tactical tool, simpler is always better.
> 
> ...
> 
> My trading strategy is short-term so I use 20-period, 55-period, 100-period, and 200-period moving averages on 10-minute and 1-hour charts. I prefer the 55-hour and 200-hour moving averages as fast and slow indicators for my trading but whether you use 55-hour or 100-hour or 200-hour, the idea and results will be about the same.

> First, the basics of candlestick construction. The difference between the open and the close is called the body of the candlestick. That is the fat part that is black and white (some systems use green and red in place of black and white). The tails outside the body are called the shadow of the candlestick and represent the full range that traded outside of the OPEN/CLOSE range.
> 
> When the candle is green or white, it means the currency pair went up on the day and if it is red or black the currency pair went down. So, to recap, the body is the open to close range, the color defines if the currency pair rose or fell, and the shadows (sometimes called wicks, as in candle wicks) are the intraday extension outside the open-to-close range.

### Chapter 1. Philosophy of Technical Analysis

> Technical analysis is the study of market action, primarily through the use of charts, for the purpose of forecasting future price trends.
> 
> ...
> 
> There are three premises on which the technical approach is based:
> 
> 1. Market action discounts everything.
> 2. Prices move in trends.
> 3. History repeats itself.
> 
> ...
> 
> The technician believes that anything that can possibly affect the price—fundamentally, politically, psychologically, or otherwise—is actually reflected in the price of that market. It follows, therefore, that a study of price action is all that is required.
> 
> ...
> 
> There is a corollary to the premise that prices move in trends—_a trend in motion is more likely to continue than to reverse_.
> 
> ...
> 
> Since these patterns have worked well in the past, it is assumed that they will continue to work well in the future. They are based on the study of human psychology, which tends not to change. Another way of saying this last premise—that history repeats itself—is that the key to understanding the future lies in a study of the past, or that the future is just a repetition of the past.
> 
> While technical analysis concentrates on the study of market action, fundamental analysis focuses on the economic forces of supply and demand that cause prices to move higher, lower, or stay the same. ... The intrinsic value is what the fundamentals indicate something is actually worth based on the law of supply and demand.
> 
> ...
> 
> _The fundamentalist studies the cause of market movement, while the technician studies the effect_.
> 
> ...
> 
> Usually at the beginning of important market moves, the fundamentals do not explain or support what the market seems to be doing.
> 
> ...
> 
> Chart reading becomes a shortcut form of fundamental analysis. The reverse, however, is not true. Fundamental analysis does not include a study of price action. It is possible to trade financial markets using just the technical approach. It is doubtful that anyone could trade off the fundamentals alone with no consideration of the technical side of the market.
> 
> ... Because of the high leverage factor in the futures markets, timing is especially crucial in that arena.
> 
> ... A “buy and hold” strategy doesn’t apply to the futures arena. Both the technical and the fundamental approach can be used in the first phase—the forecasting process. However, the question of timing, of determining specific entry and exit points, is almost purely technical. Therefore, considering the steps the trader must go through before making a market commitment, it can be seen that the correct application of technical principles becomes indispensable at some point in the process, even if fundamental analysis was applied in the earlier stages of the decision. ...
> 
> One of the great strengths of technical analysis is its adaptability to virtually any trading medium and time dimension. There is no area of trading in either stocks or futures where these principles do not apply.
> 
> ...
> 
> The fundamentalist, however, who tends to specialize in only one group, doesn’t have that kind of flexibility.
> 
> ...
> 
> Rising commodity prices generally hint at a stronger economy and rising inflationary pressure. Falling commodity prices usually warn that the economy is slowing along with inflation. ... As a result, charts of commodity markets like gold and oil, along with Treasury Bonds, can tell us a lot about the strength or weakness of the economy and inflationary expectations. ... Even more impressive is the fact that trends in these futures markets usually show up long before they are reflected in traditional economic indicators that are released on a monthly or quarterly basis, and usually tell us what has already happened.
> 
> ...
> 
> The pricing structure in futures is much more complicated than in stocks. Each commodity is quoted in different units and increments. Grain markets, for example, are quoted in cents per bushel, livestock markets in cents per pound, gold and silver in dollars per ounce, and interest rates in basis points. The trader must learn the contract details of each market: which exchange it is traded on, how each contract is quoted, what the minimum and maximum price increments are, and what these price increments are worth.
> 
> Unlike stocks, futures contracts have expiration dates.
> 
> ...
> 
> All futures are traded on margin, which is usually less than 10% of the value of the contract. ... Relatively small price moves in either direction tend to become magnified in their impact on overall trading results. For this reason, it is possible to make or lose large sums of money very quickly in futures. Because a trader puts up only 10% of the value of the contract as margin, then a 10% move in either direction will either double the trader’s money or wipe it out. ...
> 
> From the standpoint of technical analysis, the high leverage factor makes timing in the futures markets much more critical than it is in stocks. The correct timing of entry and exit points is crucial in futures trading and much more difficult and frustrating than market analysis. Largely for this reason, technical trading skills become indispensable to a successful futures trading program.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Timing is everything in futures trading_. Determining the correct direction of the market only solves a portion of the trading problem. If the timing of the entry point is off by a day, or sometimes even minutes, it can mean the difference between a winner or a loser. It’s bad enough to be on the wrong side of the market and lose money. Being on the right side of the market and still losing money is one of the most frustrating and unnerving aspects of futures trading. It goes without saying that timing is almost purely technical in nature, because the fundamentals rarely change on a day-to-day basis.
> 
> ...
> 
> Technical analysis in stocks relies much more heavily on the use of _sentiment indicators and flow of funds analysis_. Sentiment indicators monitor the performance of different groups such as odd lotters, mutual funds, and floor specialists. Enormous importance is placed on sentiment indicators that measure the overall market bullishness and bearishness on the theory that the majority opinion is usually wrong. _Flow of funds_ analysis refers to the cash position of different groups, such as mutual funds or large institutional accounts. The thinking here is that the larger the cash position, the more funds that are available for stock purchases.
> 
> ...
> 
> The _Random Walk Theory_, developed and nurtured in the academic community, claims that price changes are “serially independent” and that price history is not a reliable indicator of future price direction. In a nutshell, price movement is random and unpredictable. The theory is based on the _efficient market hypothesis_, which holds that prices fluctuate randomly about their intrinsic value. It also holds that the best market strategy to follow would be a simple “buy and hold” strategy as opposed to any attempt to “beat the market.”
> 
> ...
> 
> ... However, the idea that markets are random is totally rejected by the technical community. If the markets were truly random, no forecasting technique would work.

### Chapter 2. Dow Theory

> Charles Dow and his partner Edward Jones founded Dow Jones & Company in 1882. Most technicians and students of the markets concur that much of what we call technical analysis today has its origins in theories first proposed by Dow around the turn of the century. Dow published his ideas in a series of editorials he wrote for the Wall Street Journal. Most technicians today recognize and assimilate Dow’s basic ideas, whether or not they recognize the source. Dow Theory still forms the cornerstone of the study of technical analysis, even in the face of today’s sophisticated computer technology, and the proliferation of newer and supposedly better technical indicators.
> 
> On July 3, 1884, Dow published the first stock market average composed of the closing prices of eleven stocks: nine railroad companies and two manufacturing firms. Dow felt that these eleven stocks provided a good indication of the economic health of the country. In 1897, Dow determined that two separate indices would better represent that health, and created a 12 stock industrial index and a 20 stock rail index. By 1928 the industrial index had grown to include 30 stocks, the number at which it stands today.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dow applied his theoretical work to the stock market averages that he created; namely the Industrials and the Rails. However, most of his analytical ideas apply equally well to all market averages.
> 
> ...
> 
> Sound familiar? The idea that the markets reflect every possible knowable factor that affects overall supply and demand is one of the basic premises of technical theory ... The theory applies to market averages, as well as it does to individual markets, and even makes allowances for “acts of God.” While the markets cannot anticipate events such as earthquakes and various other natural calamities, they quickly discount such occurrences, and almost instantaneously assimilate their affects into the price action.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dow believed that the laws of action and reaction apply to the markets just as they do to the physical universe. He wrote, “Records of trading show that in many cases when a stock reaches top it will have a moderate decline and then go back again to near the highest figures. If after such a move, the price again recedes, it is liable to decline some distance” ...
> 
> Dow considered a trend to have three parts, _primary_, _secondary_, and _minor_, which he compared to the tide, waves, and ripples of the sea. The primary trend represents the tide, the secondary or intermediate trend represents the waves that make up the tide, and the minor trends behave like ripples on the waves.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dow focused his attention on primary or major trends, which he felt usually take place in three distinct phases: an accumulation phase, a public participation phase, and a distribution phase. ... The distribution phase takes place when newspapers begin to print increasingly bullish stories ...
> 
> ...
> 
> Dow, in referring to the Industrial and Rail Averages, meant that no important bull or bear market signal could take place unless both averages gave the same signal, thus confirming each other. He felt that both averages must exceed a previous secondary peak to confirm the inception or continuation of a bull market. He did not believe that the signals had to occur simultaneously, but recognized that a shorter length of time between the two signals provided stronger confirmation. When the two averages diverged from one another, Dow assumed that the prior trend was still maintained. ...
> 
> Dow recognized volume as a secondary but important factor in confirming price signals. Simply stated, _volume should expand or increase in the direction of the major trend_. In a major uptrend, volume would then increase as prices move higher, and diminish as prices fall. In a downtrend, volume should increase as prices drop and diminish as they rally. Dow considered volume a secondary indicator. He based his actual buy and sell signals entirely on closing prices.
> 
> ...
> 
> It relates a physical law to market movement, which states that an object in motion (in this case a trend) tends to continue in motion until some external force causes it to change direction.
>

> 
> ![Basic Tenets: Failure Swing](/.attachments/basic.tent-failure.swing.png)
> 
> _Failure Swing. The failure of the peak at C to overcome A, followed by the violation of the low at B, constitutes a “sell” signal at S._
> 
> ![Basic Tenets: Nonfailure Swing](/.attachments/basic.tenet-nonfailure.swing.png)
> 
> _Nonfailure Swing. Notice that C exceeds A before falling below B. Some Dow theorists would see a “sell” signal at S1, while others would need to see a lower high at E before turning bearish at S2._

> Dow relied exclusively on closing prices. ...
> 
> ![Basic Tenet: Failure Swing Bottom](/.attachments/basic.tenet.buy.signal.png)
>
> _Failure Swing Bottom. The “buy” signal takes place when point B is exceeded (at B1)._
> 
> ...
> 
> In response to this criticism, traders must remember that Dow never intended to anticipate trends; rather he sought to recognize the emergence of major bull and bear markets and to capture the large middle portion of important market moves. ...
> 
> Dow apparently never intended to use his theory to forecast the direction of the stock market. He felt its real value was to use stock market direction as a barometric reading of general business conditions. We can only marvel at Dow’s vision and genius. In addition to formulating a great deal of today’s price forecasting methodology, he was among the first to recognize the usefulness of stock market averages as a leading economic indicator.
> 
> ... 
> 
> ... The standard definition of a trend, the classification of a trend into three categories and phases, the principles of confirmation and divergence, the interpretation of volume, and the use of percentage retracements (to name a few), all derive, in one way or another, from Dow Theory.

### Chapter 4. Basic Concepts of Trend

> The concept of _trend_ is absolutely essential to the technical approach to market analysis. All of the tools used by the chartist—support and resistance levels, price patterns, moving averages, trendlines, etc.—have the sole purpose of helping to measure the trend of the market for the purpose of participating in that trend. We often hear such familiar expressions as “always trade in the direction of the trend,” “never buck the trend,” or “the trend is your friend.” So let’s spend a little time to define what a trend is and classify it into a few categories.
> 
> In a general sense, the trend is simply the direction of the market, which way it’s moving. But we need a more precise definition with which to work. First of all, markets don’t generally move in a straight line in any direction. Market moves are characterized by a series of _zigzags_. These zigzags resemble a series of successive waves with fairly obvious peaks and troughs. _It is the direction of those peaks and troughs that constitutes market trend_.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... trend is usually broken down into the three categories mentioned in the previous chapter. Those three categories are the _major_, _intermediate_, and _near term trends_.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Classification](/.attachments/chart.trends.classification.png)
> 
> _Example of the three degrees of trend: major, secondary, and near term. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 show the major uptrend. Wave 2-3 represents a secondary correction within the major uptrend. Each secondary wave in turn divides into near term trends. For example, secondary wave 2-3 divides into minor waves A-B-C._
>
> ![Chart Trends: Classification - Real Life Visualization](/.attachments/chart.trends.classification-real.png)
> 
> _The major trend (over a year) is up during 1997. A short term correction occurred during March. An intermediate correction lasted from August to November (three months). The intermediate correction broke down into three short term trends._
> 
> Quite a bit of misunderstanding arises because of different traders’ perceptions as to what is meant by a trend. To long term position traders, a few days’ to a few weeks’ price action might be insignificant. To a day trader, a two or three day advance might constitute a major uptrend. It’s especially important, then, to understand the different degrees of trend and to make sure that all involved in a transaction are talking about the same ones.
> 
> As a general statement, most trend-following approaches focus on the intermediate trend, which may last for several months. The near term trend is used primarily for timing purposes. In an intermediate uptrend, short term setbacks would be used to initiate long positions.
> 
> ...
> 
> The troughs, or reaction lows, are called _support_. The term is self-explanatory and indicates that support is a level or area on the chart _under the market_ where buying interest is sufficiently strong to overcome selling pressure. As a result, a decline is halted and prices turn back up again.
> 
> _Resistance_ is the opposite of support and represents a price level or area _over the market_ where selling pressure overcomes buying pressure and a price advance is turned back.
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Resistance and Support](/.attachments/chart.trends.resistance.support.png)
> 
> _Shows rising support and resistance levels in uptrend. Points 2 and 4 are support levels which are usually previous reaction lows. Points 1 and 3 are resistance levels, usually marked by previous peaks._
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Resistance and Support - Down Trend](/.attachments/chart.trends.resistance.support.downtrend.png)
> 
> _Shows support and resistance in a downtrend._
> 
> In an uptrend, the resistance levels represent pauses in that uptrend and are usually exceeded at some point. In a downtrend, support levels are not sufficient to stop the decline permanently, but are able to check it at least temporarily.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... If the support level is violated, then a trend _reversal_ from up to down is likely.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Whenever a support or resistance level is penetrated by a significant amount, they reverse their roles and become the opposite_. In other words, a resistance level becomes a support level and support becomes resistance.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Top Reversal](/.attachments/chart.trends.top.reversal.png)
> 
> _Example of a trend reversal. The failure of prices at point 5 to exceed the previous peak at point 3 followed by a downside violation of the previous low at point 4 constitutes a downside trend reversal. This type of pattern is called a double top._
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Bottom Reversal](/.attachments/chart.trends.bottom.reversal.png)
> 
> _Example of a bottom reversal pattern. Usually the first sign of a bottom is the ability of prices at point 5 to hold above the previous low at point 3. The bottom is confirmed when the peak at 4 is overcome._
> 
> ...
> 
> _The longer the period of time that prices trade in a support or resistance area, the more significant that area becomes_. For example, if prices trade sideways for three weeks in a congestion area before moving higher, that support area would be more important than if only three days of trading had occurred.
> 
> _Volume is another way to measure the significance of support and resistance_. If a support level is formed on heavy volume, this would indicate that a large number of units changed hands, and would mark that support level as more important than if very little trading had taken place. Point and figure charts that measure the intraday trading activity are especially useful in identifying these price levels where most of the trading took place and, consequently, where support and resistance will be most likely to function.
> 
> _A third way to determine the significance of a support or resistance area is how recently the trading took place_. Because we are dealing with the reaction of traders to market movement and to positions that they have already taken or failed to take, it stands to reason that the more recent the activity, the more potent it becomes.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Chart analysis is actually a study of human psychology and the reactions of traders to changing market conditions. ...
> 
> ...
> 
> There is a tendency for round numbers to stop advances or declines. Traders tend to think in terms of important round numbers, such as 10, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100 (and multiples of 1000), as price objectives and act accordingly. These round numbers, therefore, will often act as “psychological” support or resistance levels. A trader can use this information to begin taking profits as an important round number is approached.
> 
> ...
> 
> One trading application of this principle is to _avoid placing trading orders right at these obvious round numbers_. ... As a general rule, _avoid placing protective stops at obvious round numbers_.

> 
> ...
> 
> It was mentioned earlier that support and resistance levels became the opposite once violated. The same principle holds true of trendlines. In other words, an up trendline (a support line) will usually become a resistance line once it’s decisively broken. A down trendline (a resistance line) will often become a support line once it’s decisively broken. This is why it’s usually a good idea to project all trendlines as far out to the right on the chart as possible even after they’ve been broken.
>
> This brings us to another interesting use of the trendline—the _fan principle_. ... The term “fan principle” derives from the appearance of the lines that gradually flatten out, resembling a fan. _The important point to remember here is that the breaking of the third line is the valid trend reversal signal_.
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Fan Principle - Breaking Up trend](/.attachments/chart.trends.fan.principle-1.png)

> 
> ...
> 
> In examining the three lines in the fan principle, it’s interesting to note how often the number three shows up in the study of technical analysis and the important role it plays in so many technical approaches. For example, the fan principle uses three lines; major bull and bear markets usually have three major phases (Dow Theory and Elliott Wave Theory); there are three kinds of gaps (to be covered shortly); some of the more commonly known reversal patterns, such as the triple top and the head and shoulders, have three prominent peaks; there are three different classifications of trend (major, secondary, and minor) and three trend directions (up, down, and sideways); among the generally accepted continuation patterns, there are three types of triangles—the symmetrical, ascending, and descending; there are three principle sources of information—price, volume, and open interest. For whatever the reason, the number three plays a very prominent role throughout the entire field of technical analysis.

> 
> ![Chart Trends: Relative Steepness](/.attachments/chart.trends.steepness.png)
> 
> _Most valid trendlines rise at an angle approximating 45 degrees (see line 2). If the trendline is too steep (line 1), it usually indicates that the rate of ascent is not sustainable. A trendline that is too flat (line 3) suggests that the uptrend is too weak and probably suspect. Many technicians use 45 degree lines from previous tops or bottoms as major trendlines._
> 
> ...
> 
> In the case of an accelerating trend, sometimes several trendlines may have to be drawn at increasingly steeper angles. In my experience, however, where steeper trendlines become necessary, it is best to resort to another tool—_the moving average_—which is the same as a curvilinear trendline. One of the advantages of having access to several different types of technical indicators is being able to choose the one most appropriate for a given situation. All of the techniques covered in this book work well in certain situations, but not so well in others. By having an arsenal of tools to fall back on, the technician can quickly switch from one tool to another that might work better in a given situation. An accelerated trend is one of those cases where a moving average would be more useful than a series of steeper and steeper trendlines.
> 
> ...
>
> The _channel line_, or the _return line_ as it is sometimes called, is another useful variation of the trendline technique. Sometimes prices trend between two parallel lines—the basic trendline and the channel line. Obviously, when this is the case and when the analyst recognizes that a channel exists, this knowledge can be used to profitable advantage.

> 
> The breaking of the major trendline indicates an important change in trend.

The failure of prices to reach the top of the channel (at point 5 in chart above) may be an early warning that the trend is turning, and increases the odds that the other line (the basic up trendline) will be broken. As a general rule of thumb, the failure of any move within an established price channel to reach one side of the channel usually indicates that the trend is shifting, and increases the likelihood that the other side of the channel will be broken.

> 
> Besides the 50% retracement, there are minimum and maximum percentage parameters that are also widely recognized—_the one-third and the two-thirds retracements_. In other words, the price trend can be divided into thirds. Usually, a minimum retracement is about 33% and a maximum about 66%. What this means is that, in a correction of a strong trend, the market usually retraces at least a third of the previous move. This is very useful information for a number of reasons. If a trader is looking for a buying area under the market, he or she can just compute a 33-50% zone on the chart and use that price zone as a general frame of reference for buying opportunities.

When we get to the Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci ratios, we will see that followers of that approach use percentage retracements of 38% and 62%. I prefer to combine both approaches for a minimum retracement zone of 33-38% and a maximum zone of 62-66%. Some technicians round off these numbers even further to arrive at a 40-60% retracement zone.

The 38% and 62% lines are Fibonacci retracements and are popular with chartists._

Fibonacci retracement levels are used in technical analysis because of their perceived significance in identifying potential levels of support and resistance in financial markets. The Fibonacci sequence and its associated ratios are believed to reflect natural patterns and occurrences found in various aspects of life, including financial markets.

The significance lies in the observation that these ratios, derived from the Fibonacci sequence (like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, etc.), tend to correspond with levels where price corrections often occur within a larger trend. Here are a few reasons why they are used:

1. **Nature's Presence**: The Fibonacci sequence and ratios appear in natural phenomena, from the arrangement of leaves on plants to the proportions of the human body. This prevalence in nature leads some to believe that these ratios may also influence market behavior.

2. **Psychological Levels**: Many traders and analysts believe that these Fibonacci levels are psychologically important to market participants. As a result, when these levels are reached, traders may buy or sell, causing price reactions.

3. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**: The widespread use of Fibonacci retracements by traders and analysts means that these levels often become self-fulfilling prophecies. As more people use and act upon these levels, they can impact market behavior.

4. **Support and Resistance**: The levels derived from the Fibonacci sequence are believed to represent potential areas of support (where prices may stop falling) or resistance (where prices may stop rising) within a larger trend.

However, it's important to note that while Fibonacci retracements are widely used, they are not foolproof indicators. Market movements are influenced by various factors, and these levels should ideally be used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools and indicators for more robust trading decisions.

> Speaking of thirds, let’s touch on another technique that combines the trendline with percentage retracements—speedlines. This technique, developed by Edson Gould, is actually an adaptation of the idea of dividing the trend into thirds. The main difference from the percentage retracement concept is that the speed resistance lines (or speedlines) measure the rate of ascent or descent of a trend (in other words, its speed).
> 
> To construct a bullish _speedline_, find the highest point in the current uptrend. From that high point on the chart, a vertical line is drawn toward the bottom of the chart to where the trend began. That vertical line is then divided into thirds. A trendline is then drawn from the beginning of the trend through the two points marked off on the vertical line, representing the one-third and two-thirds points.
> 
> In a downtrend, just reverse the process. Measure the vertical distance from the low point in the downtrend to the beginning of the trend, and draw two lines from the beginning of the trend through the one-third and two-thirds points on the vertical line.

> 
> _Examples of speed resistance lines in an uptrend. The vertical distance from the peak to the beginning of the trend is divided into thirds. Two trendlines are then drawn from point 1 through points 2 and 3. The upper line is the 2/3 speedline and the lower, the 1/3. The lines should act as support during market corrections. When they’re broken, they revert to resistance lines on bounces. Sometimes these speedlines intersect price action._
> 
> Each time a new high is set in an uptrend or a new low in a downtrend, a new set of lines must be drawn (because there is now a new high or low point). Because the _speedlines_ are drawn from the beginning of the trend to the one-third and two-thirds points, those trendlines may sometimes move through some of the price action. This is one case where trendlines are not drawn under lows or over highs, but actually through the price action.
> 
> ...
> 
> Charting software also allows the drawing of _Gann_ and _Fibonacci_ fan lines. _Fibonacci_ fan lines are drawn in the same fashion as the speedline. Except that Fibonacci lines are drawn at 38% and 62% angles. _Gann_ lines (named after the legendary commodity trader, W.D. Gann) are trendlines drawn from prominent tops or bottoms at specific geometric angles. The most important Gann line is drawn at a 45 degree angle from a peak or trough. Steeper Gann lines can be drawn during an uptrend at 63 3⁄ 4 degree and 75 degree angles. Flatter Gann lines can be drawn at 26 1⁄ 4 and 15 degree lines. It’s possible to draw as many as nine different Gann lines.
> 
> Gann and Fibonacci lines are used in the same way as speedlines. They are supposed to provide support during downward corrections. When one line is broken, prices will usually fall to the next lower line. Gann lines are somewhat controversial. Even if one of them works, you can’t be sure in advance which one it will be. Some chartists question the validity of drawing geometric trendlines at all.

> A _reversal day_ takes place either at a top or a bottom. The generally accepted definition of a _top reversal day_ is the setting of a new high in an uptrend, followed by a lower close on the same day. In other words, prices set a new high for a given upmove at some point during the day (usually at or near the opening) then weaken and actually close lower than the previous day’s closing. A _bottom reversal day_ would be a new low during the day followed by a higher close.
>

> 
> The bottom reversal day is sometimes referred to as a _selling climax_. This is usually a dramatic turnaround at the bottom of a down move where all the discouraged longs have finally been forced out of the market on heavy volume. The subsequent absence of selling pressure creates a vacuum over the market, which prices quickly rally to fill. The selling climax is one of the more dramatic examples of the reversal day and, while it may not mark the final bottom of a falling market, it usually signals that a significant low has been seen.

> Price _gaps_ are simply areas on the bar chart where no trading has taken place. In an uptrend, for example, prices open above the highest price of the previous day, leaving a gap or open space on the chart that is not filled during the day. In a downtrend, the day’s highest price is below the previous day’s low. Upside gaps are signs of market strength, while downside gaps are usually signs of weakness. Gaps can appear on long term weekly and monthly charts and, when they do, are usually very significant. But they are more commonly seen on daily bar charts.

> Several myths exist concerning the interpretation of gaps. One of the maxims often heard is that “gaps are always filled.” This is simply not true. Some should be filled and others shouldn’t. We’ll also see that gaps have different forecasting implications depending on which types they are and where they occur.
> 
> There are three general types of gaps—_the breakaway_, _runaway (or measuring)_, and _exhaustion gaps_.
> 
> The _breakaway gap_ usually occurs at the completion of an important price pattern, and usually signals the beginning of a significant market move. After a market has completed a major basing pattern, the breaking of resistance often occurs on a breakaway gap. Major breakouts from topping or basing areas are breeding grounds for this type of gap. The breaking of a major trendline, signaling a reversal of trend, might also see a breakaway gap.
> 
> Breakaway gaps usually occur on heavy volume. More often than not, breakaway gaps are not filled. Prices may return to the upper end of the gap (in the case of a bullish breakout), and may even close a portion of the gap, but some portion of the gap is often left unfilled. As a rule, the heavier the volume after such a gap appears, the less likely it is to be filled. Upside gaps usually act as support areas on subsequent market corrections. It’s important that prices not fall below gaps during an uptrend. In all cases a close below an upward gap is a sign of weakness.

Notice that the breakaway and runaway gaps were not filled on the way up, which is often the case._
> 
> After the move has been underway for awhile, somewhere around the middle of the move, prices will leap forward to form a second type of gap (or a series of gaps) called the _runaway gap_. This type of gap reveals a situation where the market is moving effortlessly on moderate volume. In an uptrend, it’s a sign of market strength; in a downtrend, a sign of weakness. Here again, runaway gaps act as support under the market on subsequent corrections and are often not filled. As in the case of the breakaway, a close below the runaway gap is a negative sign in an uptrend.

> 
> This variety of gap is also called a _measuring gap_ because it usually occurs at about the halfway point in a trend. By measuring the distance the trend has already traveled, from the original trend signal or breakout, an estimate of the probable extent of the remaining move can be determined by doubling the amount already achieved.
> 
> The final type of gap appears near the end of a market move. After all objectives have been achieved and the other two types of gaps (breakaway and runaway) have been identified, the analyst should begin to expect the _exhaustion gap_. Near the end of an uptrend, prices leap forward in a last gasp, so to speak. However, that upward leap quickly fades and prices turn lower within a couple of days or within a week. When prices close under that last gap, it is usually a dead giveaway that the exhaustion gap has made its appearance. This is a classic example where falling below a gap in an uptrend has very bearish implications.
> 
> This takes us to the _island reversal pattern_. Sometimes after the upward exhaustion gap has formed, prices will trade in a narrow range for a couple of days or a couple of weeks before gapping to the downside. Such a situation leaves the few days of price action looking like an “island” surrounded by space or water. The exhaustion gap to the upside followed by a breakaway gap to the downside completes the island reversal pattern and usually indicates a trend reversal of some magnitude. Of course, the major significance of the reversal depends on where prices are in the general trend structure.

### Chapter 5. Major Reversal Patterns

> There are two major categories of price patterns—reversal and continuation. As these names imply, reversal patterns indicate that an important reversal in trend is taking place. The continuation patterns, on the other hand, suggest that the market is only pausing for awhile, possibly to correct a near term overbought or oversold condition, after which the existing trend will be resumed. The trick is to distinguish between the two types of patterns as early as possible during the formation of the pattern.
>

> **Preliminary Points Common to All Reversal Patterns**

> Before beginning our discussion of the individual major reversal patterns, there are a few preliminary points to be considered that are common to all of these reversal patterns.
> 
> 1. A prerequisite for any reversal pattern is the existence of a prior trend.
> 2. The first signal of an impending trend reversal is often the breaking of an important trendline.
> 3. The larger the pattern, the greater the subsequent move.
> 4. Topping patterns are usually shorter in duration and more volatile than bottoms.
> 5. Bottoms usually have smaller price ranges and take longer to build.
> 6. Volume is usually more important on the upside.
> 
> ...
> 
> Price swings within the tops are wider and more violent. Tops usually take less time to form. Bottoms usually have smaller price ranges, but take longer to build. For this reason it is usually easier and less costly to identify and trade bottoms than to catch market tops. One consoling factor, which makes the more treacherous topping patterns worthwhile, is that _prices tend to decline faster than they go up_.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Markets have a way of “falling of their own weight” once a bear move gets underway. Chartists like to see an increase in trading activity as prices drop, but it is not critical. At bottoms, however, the volume pickup is absolutely essential. If the volume pattern does not show a significant increase during the upside price breakout, the entire price pattern should be questioned.

> _Example of a head and shoulders top. The left and right shoulders (A and E) are at about the same height. The head (C) is higher than either shoulder. Notice the lighter volume on each peak. The pattern is completed on a close under the neckline (line 2). The minimum objective is the vertical distance from the head to the neckline projected downward from the breaking of the neckline. A return move will often occur back to the neckline, which should not recross the neckline once it has been broken._
> 
> [From the illustration above, note that] Prices then begin to decline to point D and something even more disturbing happens. The decline carries below the top of the previous peak at point A. Remember that, in an uptrend, a penetrated peak should function as support on subsequent corrections. The decline well under point A, almost to the previous reaction low at point B, is another warning that something may be going wrong with the uptrend.
> 
> The market rallies again to point E, this time on even lighter volume, and isn’t able to reach the top of the previous peak at point C. (That last rally at point E will often retrace one-half to two-thirds of the decline from points C to D.) To continue an uptrend, each high point must exceed the high point of the rally preceding it. The failure of the rally at point E to reach the previous peak at point C fulfills half of the requirement for a new downtrend—namely, descending peaks.
> 
> By this time, the major up trendline (line 1) has already been broken, usually at point D, constituting another danger signal. But, despite all of these warnings, all that we know at this point is that the trend has shifted from up to sideways. This might be sufficient cause to liquidate long positions, but not necessarily enough to justify new short sales.
> 
> ... _The deciding factor in the resolution of the head and shoulders top is a decisive closing violation of that neckline_. The market has now violated the trendline along the bottom of points B and D, has broken under support at point D, and has completed the requirement for a new downtrend—descending peaks and troughs. The new downtrend is now identified by the declining highs and lows at points C, D, E, and F. Volume should increase on the breaking of the neckline. A sharp increase in downside volume, however, is not critically important in the initial stages of a market top.
> 
> The accompanying volume pattern plays an important role in the development of the head and shoulders top as it does in all price patterns. As a general rule, the second peak (the head) should take place on lighter volume than the left shoulder. This is not a requirement, but a strong tendency and an early warning of diminishing buying pressure. The most important volume signal takes place during the third peak (the right shoulder). Volume should be noticeably lighter than on the previous two peaks. Volume should then expand on the breaking of the neckline, decline during the return move, and then expand again once the return move is over.
> 
> As mentioned earlier, volume is less critical during the completion of market tops. But, at some point, volume should begin to increase if the new downtrend is to be continued. Volume plays a much more decisive role at market bottoms, a subject to be discussed shortly. Before doing so, however, let’s discuss the measuring implications of the head and shoulders pattern.

> 
> The most important difference between the top and bottom patterns is the volume sequence. Volume plays a much more critical role in the identification and completion of a head and shoulders bottom. This point is generally true of all bottom patterns. It was stated earlier that markets have a tendency to “fall of their own weight.” At bottoms, however, markets require a significant increase in buying pressure, reflected in greater volume, to launch a new bull market.
> 
> A more technical way of looking at this difference is that a market can fall just from inertia. Lack of demand or buying interest on the part of traders is often enough to push a market lower; but a market does not go up on inertia. Prices only rise when demand exceeds supply and buyers are more aggressive than sellers.
> 
> The volume pattern at the bottom is very similar to that at the top for the first half of the pattern. That is, the volume at the head is a bit lighter than that at the left shoulder. The rally from the head, however, should begin to show not only an increase in trading activity, but the level of volume often exceeds that registered on the rally from the left shoulder. The dip to the right shoulder should be on very light volume. The critical point occurs at the rally through the neckline. This signal must be accompanied by a sharp burst of trading volume if the breakout is for real.
> 
> This point is where the bottom differs the most from the top. At the bottom, heavy volume is an absolutely essential ingredient in the completion of the basing pattern. The return move is more common at bottoms than at tops and should occur on light volume. Following that, the new uptrend should resume on heavier volume. The measuring technique is the same as at the top.
> 
> ...
> 
> Market tactics play an important role in all trading. Not all technical traders like to wait for the breaking of the neckline before initiating a new position. ... more aggressive traders, believing that they have correctly identified a head and shoulders bottom, will begin to probe the long side during the formation of the right shoulder. Or they will buy the first technical signal that the decline into the right shoulder has ended.
> 
> ...
> 
> Once prices have moved through the neckline and completed a head and shoulders pattern, _prices should not recross the neckline again_. At a top, once the neckline has been broken on the downside, any decisive close back above the neckline is a serious warning that the initial breakdown was probably a bad signal, and creates what is often called, for obvious reasons, _a failed head and shoulders_. This type of pattern starts out looking like a classic head and shoulders reversal, but at some point in its development (either prior to the breaking of the neckline or just after it), prices resume their original trend.

One-half to two-thirds pullback of the rally from points C to D, a decline to the same level as the left shoulder at point A, or the breaking of a short term down trendline (line 1) all provide early opportunities for market entry. More positions can be added on the breaking of the neckline or the return move back to the neckline._
> 
> There are two important lessons here. The first is that none of these chart patterns are infallible. They work most of the time, but not always. The second lesson is that technical traders must always be on the alert for chart signs that their analysis is incorrect. One of the keys to survival in the financial markets is to keep trading losses small and to exit a losing trade as quickly as possible. One of the greatest advantages of chart analysis is its ability to quickly alert the trader to the fact that he or she is on the wrong side of the market. The ability and willingness to quickly recognize trading errors and to take defensive action immediately are qualities not to be taken lightly in the financial markets.

> ...
> 
> Most of the points covered in the treatment of the head and shoulders pattern are also applicable to other types of reversal patterns. The triple top or bottom, which is much rarer in occurrence, is just a slight variation of that pattern. The main difference is that the three peaks or troughs in the triple top or bottom are at about the same level. Chartists often disagree as to whether a reversal pattern is a head and shoulders or a triple top. The argument is academic, because both patterns imply the exact same thing.
> 
> The volume tends to decline with each successive peak at the top and should increase at the breakdown point. The triple top is not complete until support levels along both of the intervening lows have been broken. Conversely, prices must close through the two intervening peaks at the bottom to complete a triple bottom. (As an alternate strategy, the breaking of the nearest peak or trough can also be used as a reversal signal.) Heavy upside volume on the completion of the bottom is also essential.

Because the triple top or bottom represents only a minor variation of the head and shoulders pattern, we won’t say much more about it here.
> 
> A much more common reversal pattern is the double top or bottom. Next to the head and shoulders, it is the most frequently seen and the most easily recognized. For obvious reasons, the top is often referred to as an “M” and the bottom as a “W.” The general characteristics of a double top are similar to that of the head and shoulders and triple top except that only two peaks appear instead of three.

On occasion, the second peak will not quite reach the level of the first peak, which is not too problematical. What does cause some problems is when the second peak actually exceeds the first peak by a slight margin. What at first may appear to be a valid upside breakout and resumption of the uptrend may turn out to be part of the topping process. To help resolve this dilemma, some of the filtering criteria already mentioned may come in handy.
> 
> Most chartists require a close beyond a previous resistance peak instead of just an intraday penetration. Second, a price filter of some type might be used. One such example is a percentage penetration criterion (such as 1% or 3%). Third, the two day penetration rule could be used as an example of a time filter. In other words, prices would have to close beyond the top of the first peak for two consecutive days to signal a valid penetration. Another time filter could be a Friday close beyond the previous peak. The volume on the upside breakout might also provide a clue to its reliability.
> 
> These filters are certainly not infallible, but do serve to reduce the number of false signals (or whipsaws) that often occur. Sometimes these filters are helpful, and sometimes they’re not. The analyst must face the realization that he or she is dealing with percentages and probabilities, and that there will be times when bad signals occur. That’s simply a fact of trading life.

> 
> The terms “double top and bottom” are greatly overused in the financial markets. Most potential double tops or bottoms wind up being something else. The reason for this is that prices have a strong tendency to back off from a previous peak or bounce off a previous low. These price changes are a natural reaction and do not in themselves constitute a reversal pattern. Remember that, at a top, prices must actually violate the previous reaction low before the double top exists.

> 
> ...
> 
> ... It is very difficult for the chartist to determine whether the pullback from the previous peak or the bounce from the previous low is just a temporary setback in the existing trend or the start of a double top or bottom reversal pattern. Because the technical odds usually favor continuation of the present trend, it is usually wise to await completion of the pattern before taking action.

### Chapter 6. Continuation Patterns

> Reversal patterns usually take much longer to build and represent major trend changes. Continuation patterns, on the other hand, are usually shorter term in duration and are more accurately classified as near term or intermediate patterns.
> 
> ...
> 
> There are three types of triangles—symmetrical, ascending, and descending. (Some chartists include a fourth type of triangle known as an expanding triangle, or broadening formation. This is treated as a separate pattern later.) Each type of triangle has a slightly different shape and has different forecasting implications.
> 
> The symmetrical triangle shows two converging trendlines, the upper line descending and the lower line ascending. The vertical line at the left, measuring the height of the pattern, is called the base. The point of intersection at the right, where the two lines meet, is called the apex. For obvious reasons, the symmetrical triangle is also called a coil.
> 
> The ascending triangle has a rising lower line with a flat or horizontal upper line The descending triangle, by contrast, has the upper line declining with a flat or horizontal bottom line. Let’s see how each one is interpreted.
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bullish Symmetrical](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-symmetrical.png)
> 
> _Example of a bullish symmetrical triangle. Notice the two converging trendlines. A close outside either trendline completes the pattern. The vertical line at the left is the base. The point at the right where the two lines meet is the apex._
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Ascending Triangle](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-ascending.png)
> 
> _Example of a bullish symmetrical triangle. Notice the two converging trendlines. A close outside either trendline completes the pattern. The vertical line at the left is the base. The point at the right where the two lines meet is the apex._
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Descending Triangle](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-descending.png)
> 
> _Example of a descending triangle. Notice the flat bottom line and the declining upper line. This is usually a bearish pattern._
> 
> **THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE**
> 
> The _symmetrical triangle_ (or the coil) is usually a continuation pattern. It represents a pause in the existing trend after which the original trend is resumed. ...
> 
> The minimum requirement for a triangle is four reversal points. Remember that it always takes two points to draw a trendline. Therefore, in order to draw two converging trendlines, each line must be touched at least twice.
> 
> ...
> 
> There is a time limit for the resolution of the pattern, and that is the point where the two lines meet—at the apex. As a general rule, prices should break out in the direction of the prior trend somewhere between two-thirds to three-quarters of the horizontal width of the triangle. That is, the distance from the vertical base on the left of the pattern to the apex at the far right. Because the two lines must meet at some point, that time distance can be measured once the two converging lines are drawn. An upside breakout is signaled by a penetration of the upper trendline. If prices remain within the triangle beyond the three-quarters point, the triangle begins to lose its potency, and usually means that prices will continue to drift out to the apex and beyond.
> 
> ...
> 
> The actual trend signal is given by a closing penetration of one of the trendlines. Sometimes a return move will occur back to the penetrated trendline after the breakout. In an uptrend, that line has become a support line. In a downtrend, the lower line becomes a resistance line once it’s broken. The apex also acts as an important support or resistance level after the breakout occurs. Various penetration criteria can be applied to the breakout, similar to those covered in the previous two chapters. A minimum penetration criterion would be a closing price outside the trendline and not just an intraday penetration.
> 
> Volume should diminish as the price swings narrow within the triangle. This tendency for volume to contract is true of all consolidation patterns. But the volume should pick up noticeably at the penetration of the trendline that completes the pattern. The return move should be on light volume with heavier activity again as the trend resumes.
> 
> Two other points should be mentioned about volume. As is the case with reversal patterns, volume is more important on the upside than on the downside. An increase in volume is essential to the resumption of an uptrend in all consolidation patterns.
> 
> The second point about volume is that, even though trading activity diminishes during formation of the pattern, a close inspection of the volume usually gives a clue as to whether the heavier volume is occurring during the upmoves or down-moves. In an uptrend, for example, there should be a slight tendency for volume to be heavier during the bounces and lighter on the price dips.
> 
> ...
>
> **THE ASCENDING TRIANGLE**
> 
> The ascending and descending triangles are variations of the symmetrical, but have different forecasting implications.
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: An Ascending Triangle](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-ascending.triangle.png)
> 
> _An ascending triangle. The pattern is completed on a decisive close above the upper line. This breakout should see a sharp increase in volume. That upper resistance line should act as support on subsequent dips after the breakout. The minimum price objective is obtained by measuring the height of the triangle (AB) and projecting that distance upward from the breakout point at C._
> 
> Notice that the upper trendline is flat, while the lower line is rising. This pattern indicates that buyers are more aggressive than sellers. It is considered a bullish pattern and is usually resolved with a breakout to the upside.
> 
> ... No matter where in the trend structure the ascending or descending triangles appear, they have very definite forecasting implications. The ascending triangle is bullish and the descending triangle is bearish. The symmetrical triangle, by contrast, is inherently a neutral pattern. This does not mean, however, that the symmetrical triangle does not have forecasting value. On the contrary, because the symmetrical triangle is a continuation pattern, the analyst must simply look to see the direction of the previous trend and then make the assumption that the previous trend will continue.
> 
> ...
> 
> **THE DESCENDING TRIANGLE**
> 
> The _descending triangle_ is just a mirror image of the ascending, and is generally considered a bearish pattern. ...
> 
> ...
>
> ![Continuation Patterns: A Descending Triangle](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-descending.triangle.png)
> 
> _A descending triangle. The bearish pattern is completed with a decisive close under the lower flat line. The measuring technique is the height of the triangle (AB) projected down from the breakout at point C._
> 
> This pattern indicates that sellers are more aggressive than buyers, and is usually resolved on the downside. The downside signal is registered by a decisive close under the lower trendline, usually on increased volume. A return move sometimes occurs which should encounter resistance at the lower trendline.
> 
> ...
> 
> The volume pattern in both the ascending and descending triangles is very similar in that the volume diminishes as the pattern works itself out and then increases on the breakout. As in the case of the symmetrical triangle, during the formation the chartist can detect subtle shifts in the volume pattern coinciding with the swings in the price action. This means that in the ascending pattern, the volume tends to be slightly heavier on bounces and lighter on dips. In the descending formation, volume should be heavier on the downside and lighter during the bounces.
> 
> One final factor to be considered on the subject of triangles is that of the time dimension. The triangle is considered an intermediate pattern, meaning that it usually takes longer than a month to form, but generally less than three months. A triangle that lasts less than a month is probably a different pattern, such as a pennant, ...
> 
> **THE BROADENING FORMATION**
> 
> This next price pattern is an unusual variation of the triangle and is relatively rare. It is actually an inverted triangle or a triangle turned backwards. All of the triangular patterns examined so far show converging trendlines. The _broadening formation,_ as the name implies, is just the opposite. ...
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Broadening Top](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-broadening.top.png)
> 
> _A broadening top. This type of expanding triangle usually occurs at major tops. It shows three successively higher peaks and two declining troughs. The violation of the second trough completes the pattern. This is an unusually difficult pattern to trade and fortunately is relatively rare._
> 
> The volume pattern also differs in this formation. In the other triangular patterns, volume tends to diminish as the price swings grow narrower. Just the opposite happens in the broadening formation. _The volume tends to expand along with the wider price swings_. This situation represents a market that is out of control and unusually emotional. Because this pattern also represents an unusual amount of public participation, it most often occurs at major market tops. _The expanding pattern, therefore, is usually a bearish formation_. It generally appears near the end of a major bull market.
> 
> **FLAGS AND PENNANTS**
> 
> The _flag_ and _pennant_ formations are quite common. They are usually treated together because they are very similar in appearance, tend to show up at about the same place in an existing trend, and have the same volume and measuring criteria.
> 
> The _flag_ and _pennant_ represent brief pauses in a dynamic market move. In fact, one of the requirements for both the flag and the pennant is that they be preceded by a sharp and almost straight line move. They represent situations where a steep advance or decline has gotten ahead of itself, and where the market pauses briefly to “catch its breath” before running off again in the same direction.
> 
> Flags and pennants are among the most reliable of continuation patterns and only rarely produce a trend reversal.
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bullish Flag](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bullish.flag.png)
> 
> _Example of a bullish flag. The flag usually occurs after a sharp move and represents a brief pause in the trend. The flag should slope against the trend. Volume should dry up during the formation and build again on the breakout. The flag usually occurs near the midpoint of the move._
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bullish Pennant](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bullish.pennant.png)
> 
> _A bullish pennant. Resembles a small symmetrical triangle, but usually lasts no longer than three weeks. Volume should be light during its formation. The move after the pennant is completed should duplicate the size of the move preceding it._
> 
> ... notice the steep price advance preceding the formations on heavy volume. Notice also the dramatic drop off in activity as the consolidation patterns form and then the sudden burst of activity on the upside breakout.
> 
> The pennant is identified by two converging trendlines and is more horizontal. It very closely resembles a small symmetrical triangle. An important requirement is that volume should dry up noticeably while each of the patterns is forming.
> 
> Both patterns are relatively short term and should be completed within one to three weeks. Pennants and flags in downtrends tend to take even less time to develop, and often last no longer than one or two weeks. Both patterns are completed on the penetration of the upper trendline in an uptrend. The breaking of the lower trendline would signal resumption of downtrends. The breaking of those trendlines should take place on heavier volume. As usual, upside volume is more critically important than downside volume.
> 
> ...
> 
> **THE WEDGE FORMATION**
> 
> The _wedge_ formation is similar to a symmetrical triangle both in terms of its shape and the amount of time it takes to form. Like the symmetrical triangle, it is identified by two converging trendlines that come together at an _apex_. In terms of the amount of time it takes to form, the wedge usually lasts more than one month but not more than three months, putting it into the intermediate category.
> 
> What distinguishes the _wedge_ is its noticeable slant. The wedge pattern has a noticeable slant either to the upside or the downside. As a rule, like the flag pattern, the wedge slants against the prevailing trend. Therefore, a _falling wedge is considered bullish and a rising wedge is bearish_.
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bullish Failing Wedge](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bullish.failing.wedge.png)
> 
> _Example of a bullish falling wedge. The wedge pattern has two converging trendlines, but slopes against the prevailing trend. A falling wedge is usually bullish._
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bearish Wedge](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bearish.wedge.png)
> 
> _Example of a bearish wedge. A bearish wedge should slope upward against the prevailing downtrend._
> 
> _Wedges_ show up most often within the existing trend and usually constitute continuation patterns. The wedge can appear at tops or bottoms and signal a trend reversal. But that type of situation is much less common. Near the end of an uptrend, the chartist may observe a clearcut rising wedge. Because a continuation wedge in an uptrend should slope downward against the prevailing trend, the rising wedge is a clue to the chartist that this is a bearish and not a bullish pattern. At bottoms, a falling wedge would be a tip-off of a possible end of a bear trend.
> 
> Whether the wedge appears in the middle or the end of a market move, the market analyst should always be guided by the general maxim that _a rising wedge is bearish and a falling wedge is bullish_.
> 
> **THE RECTANGLE FORMATION**
> 
> The _rectangle formation_ often goes by other names, but is usually easy to spot on a price chart. It represents a pause in the trend during which prices move sideways between two parallel horizontal lines.
> 
> The rectangle is sometimes referred to as a _trading range_ or a _congestion area_. In Dow Theory parlance, it is referred to as a line. Whatever it is called, it usually represents just a consolidation period in the existing trend, and is usually resolved in the direction of the market trend that preceded its occurrence. In terms of forecasting value, it can be viewed as being similar to the symmetrical triangle but with flat instead of converging trendlines.
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bullish Rectangle](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bullish.rectangle.png)
> 
> _Example of a bullish rectangle in an uptrend. This pattern is also called a trading range, and shows prices trading between two horizontal trendlines. It is also called a congestion area._
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bearish Rectangle](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bearish.rectangle.png)
> 
> _Example of a bearish rectangle. While rectangles are usually considered continuation patterns, the trader must always be alert for signs that it may turn into a reversal pattern, such as a triple bottom._
> 
> A decisive close outside either the upper or lower boundary signals completion of the rectangle and points the direction of the trend. The market analyst must always be on the alert, however, that the rectangular consolidation does not turn into a reversal pattern. ...
> 
> One important clue to watch for is the volume pattern. Because the price swings in both directions are fairly broad, the analyst should keep a close eye on which moves have the heavier volume. If the rallies are on heavier and the setbacks on lighter volume, then the formation is probably a continuation in the uptrend. If the heavier volume is on the downside, then it can be considered a warning of a possible trend reversal in the works.
> 
> Some chartists trade the swings within such a pattern by buying dips near the bottom and selling rallies near the top of the range. This technique enables the short term trader to take advantage of the well defined price boundaries, and profit from an otherwise trendless market. Because the positions are being taken at the extremes of the range, the risks are relatively small and well defined. If the trading range remains intact, this countertrend trading approach works quite well. When a breakout does occur, the trader not only exits the last losing trade immediately, but can reverse the previous position by initiating a new trade in the direction of the new trend. Oscillators are especially useful in sideways trading markets, but less useful once the breakout has occurred ...
> 
> Other traders assume the rectangle is a continuation pattern and take long positions near the lower end of the price band in an uptrend, or initiate short positions near the top of the range in downtrends. Others avoid such trendless markets altogether and await a clearcut breakout before committing their funds. Most trend-following systems perform very poorly during these periods of sideways and trendless market action.
> 
> ...
> 
> **THE CONTINUATION HEAD AND SHOULDERS PATTERN**
> 
> ... The head and shoulders pattern can sometimes appear as a continuation instead of a reversal pattern.
> 
> In the continuation head and shoulders variety, prices trace out a pattern that looks very similar to a sideways rectangular pattern except that the middle trough in an uptrend tends to be lower than either of the two shoulders.
> 
> ![Continuation Patterns: Bullish Continuation Head & Shoulders](/.attachments/continuation.patterns-bullish.continuation.head.and.shoulders.png)
> 
> _Example of a bullish continuation head and shoulders pattern._

> n a downtrend, the middle peak in the consolidation exceeds the other two peaks. The result in both cases is a head and shoulders pattern turned upside down. Because it is turned upside down, there is no chance of confusing it with the reversal pattern.

### Chapter 7. Volume and Open Interest

> ... _Price_ is by far the most important. _Volume_ and _open interest_ are secondary in importance and are used primarily as confirming indicators. Of those two, volume is the more important.
> 
> ...
> 
> Open interest represents the total number of outstanding longs or shorts in the market, _not the sum of both_. Open interest is the number of contracts. A contract must have both a _buyer_ and a _seller_. Therefore, two market participants—a _buyer_ and a _seller_—combine to create only one contract. The open interest figure reported each day is followed by either a positive or negative number showing the increase or decrease in the number of contracts for that day. It is those changes in the open interest levels, either up or down, that give the chartist clues as to the changing character of market participation and give open interest its forecasting value.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... if both participants in a trade are initiating a new position, the open interest will increase. If both are liquidating an old position, the open interest will decline. If, however, one is initiating a new trade while the other is liquidating an old trade, open interest will remain unchanged. By looking at the net change in the total open interest at the end of the day, the chartist is able to determine whether money is flowing into or out of the market. This information enables the analyst to draw some conclusions about the strength or weakness of the current price trend.
> 
> ...
> 
> The level of volume measures the intensity or urgency behind the price move. Heavier volume reflects a higher degree of intensity or pressure. By monitoring the level of volume along with price action, the technician is better able to gauge the buying or selling pressure behind market moves. This information can then be used to confirm price movement or warn that a price move is not to be trusted.
> 
> To state the rule more concisely, _volume should increase or expand in the direction of the existing price trend_. In an uptrend, volume should be heavier as the price moves higher, and should decrease or contract on price dips. As long as this pattern continues, volume is said to be confirming the price trend.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Continuation patterns, like the _triangle_, should be accompanied by a gradual drop off in volume. As a rule, the resolution of all price patterns (the breakout point) should be accompanied by heavier trading activity if the signal given by that breakout is real.
> 
> In a downtrend, the volume should be heavier during down moves and lighter on bounces. As long as that pattern continues, the selling pressure is greater than buying pressure and the downtrend should continue. It’s only when that pattern begins to change that the chartist starts looking for signs of a bottom.
> 
> By monitoring the price and volume together, we’re actually using two different tools to measure the same thing—pressure. By the mere fact that prices are trending higher, we can see that there is more buying than selling pressure. It stands to reason then that the greater volume should take place in the same direction as the prevailing trend. Technicians believe that _volume precedes price_, meaning that the loss of upside pressure in an uptrend or downside pressure in a downtrend actually shows up in the volume figures before it is manifested in a reversal of the price trend.
> 
> ...
> 
> It should be noted that volume reporting in the stock market is much more useful than in the futures markets. Stock trading volume is reported immediately, while it is reported a day late for futures. Levels of upside and downside volume are also available for stocks, but not in futures. The availability of volume data for stocks on each price change during the day has facilitated an even more advanced indicator called Money Flow, developed by Laszlo Birinyi, Jr. This real-time version of OBV tracks the level of volume on each price change in order to determine if money is flowing into or out of a stock. This sophisticated calculation, however, requires a lot of computer power and isn’t readily available to most traders.
> 
> ...
> 
> Let’s summarize some of the more important elements of price, volume, and open interest.
> 
> 1. Volume is used in all markets; open interest mainly in futures.
> 2. Only the total volume and open interest are used for futures.
> 3. Increasing volume (and open interest) indicate that the current price trend will probably continue.
> 4. Declining volume (and open interest) suggest that the price trend may be changing.
> 5. Volume precedes price. Changes in buying or selling pressure are often detected in volume before price.
> 6. On balance volume (OBV), or some variation thereof, can be used to more accurately measure the direction of volume pressure.
> 7. Within an uptrend, a sudden leveling off or decline in open interest often warns of a change in trend. (This applies only to futures.)
> 8. Very high open interest at market tops is dangerous and can intensify downside pressure. (This applies only to futures.)
> 9. A buildup in open interest during consolidation periods intensifies the ensuing breakout. (This applies only to futures.)
> 10. Increases in volume (and open interest) help confirm the resolution of price patterns or any other significant chart developments that signal the beginning of a new trend.

### Chapter 8. Long Term Charts

> The average trader’s dependence on these daily charts, however, and the preoccupation with short term market behavior, cause many to overlook a very useful and rewarding area of price charting—_the use of weekly and monthly charts for longer range trend analysis and forecasting_.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Long range price charts provide a perspective on the market trend that is impossible to achieve with the use of daily charts alone_. During our introduction to the technical philosophy in Chapter 1, it was pointed out that one of the greatest advantages of chart analysis is the application of its principles to virtually any time dimension, including long range forecasting. We also addressed the fallacy, espoused by some, that technical analysis should be limited to short term “timing” with longer range forecasting left to the fundamental analyst.
> 
> ...
> 
> A question often raised concerning long term charts is whether or not historic price levels seen on the charts should be adjusted for inflation. After all, the argument goes, do these long range peaks and troughs have any validity if not adjusted to reflect the changes in the value of the U.S. dollar? This is a point of some controversy among analysts.
> 
> I do not believe that any adjustment is necessary on these long range charts for a number of reasons. The main reason is my belief that the markets themselves have already made the necessary adjustments. A currency declining in value causes commodities quoted in that currency to increase in value. The declining value of the dollar, therefore, would contribute to rising commodity prices. A rising dollar would cause the price of most commodities to fall.
> 
> ...
> 
> The final point in this debate goes to the heart of the technical theory, which states that price action discounts everything, even inflation. All financial markets adjust to periods of inflation and deflation and to changes in currency values. The real answer to whether long range charts should be adjusted for inflation lies in the charts themselves. Many markets fail at historic resistance levels set several years earlier and then bounce off support levels not seen in several years. It’s also clear that falling inflation since the early 1980s has helped support bull markets in bonds and stocks. It would seem that those markets have already made their own inflation adjustment.
> 
> ...
> 
> Long term charts are not meant for trading purposes. A distinction has to be made between market _analysis_ for forecasting purposes and the _timing_ of market commitments. Long term charts are useful in the analytical process to help determine the major trend and price objectives. They are not suitable, however, for the timing of entry and exit points and should not be used for that purpose. For that more sensitive task, daily and intraday charts should be utilized.

### Chapter 9. Moving Averages

> The _moving average_ is one of the most versatile and widely used of all technical indicators. Because of the way it is constructed and the fact that it can be so easily quantified and tested, it is the basis for many mechanical trend-following systems in use today.
> 
> _Chart analysis is largely subjective and difficult to test_. As a result, chart analysis does not lend itself that well to computerization. Moving average rules, by contrast, can easily be programmed into a computer, which then generates specific buy and sell signals. While two technicians may disagree as to whether a given price pattern is a triangle or a wedge, or whether the volume pattern favors the bull or bear side, ***moving average trend signals are precise and not open to debate***.
> 
> Let’s begin by defining what a _moving average_ is. As the second word implies, it is an _average_ of a certain body of data. For example, if a 10 day average of closing prices is desired, the prices for the last 10 days are added up and the total is divided by 10. The term _moving_ is used because only the latest 10 days’ prices are used in the calculation. Therefore, the body of data to be averaged (the last 10 closing prices) moves forward with each new trading day. The most common way to calculate the moving average is to work from the total of the last 10 days’ closing prices. Each day the new close is added to the total and the close 11 days back is subtracted. The new total is then divided by the number of days (10).
> 
> The _moving average_ is essentially a trend following device. Its purpose is to identify or signal that a new trend has begun or that an old trend has ended or reversed. Its purpose is to track the progress of the trend. It might be viewed as a curving trendline. It does not, however, predict market action in the same sense that standard chart analysis attempts to do. ***The moving average is a follower, not a leader***. It never anticipates; it only reacts. The moving average follows a market and tells us that a trend has begun, but only after the fact.
> 
> ... Shorter term averages are more sensitive to the price action, whereas longer range averages are less sensitive. In certain types of markets, it is more advantageous to use a shorter average and, at other times, a longer and less sensitive average proves more useful.
> 
> ![Moving Averages: 20 vs 200 day](/.attachments/moving.averages-20.vs.200-day.png)
> 
> _A comparison of a 20 day and a 200 day moving average. During the sideways period from August to January, prices crossed the shorter average several times. However, they remained above the 200 day average throughout the entire period._
> 
> We have been using the closing price in all of our examples so far. However, while the closing price is considered to be the most important price of the trading day and the price most commonly used in moving average construction, the reader should be aware that some technicians prefer to use other prices. Some prefer to use a midpoint value, which is arrived at by dividing the day’s range by two.
> 
> Others include the closing price in their calculation by adding the high, low, and closing prices together and dividing the sum by three. Still others prefer to construct price bands by averaging the high and low prices separately. The result is two separate moving average lines that act as a sort of volatility buffer or neutral zone. Despite these variations, the closing price is still the price most commonly used for moving average analysis and is the price that we’ll be focusing most of our attention on in this chapter.
> 
> **The Simple Moving Average**
> 
> The _simple moving average_, or the arithmetic mean, is the type used by most technical analysts. But there are some who question its usefulness on two points. The first criticism is that only the period covered by the average (the last 10 days, for example) is taken into account. The second criticism is that the simple moving average gives equal weight to each day’s price. In a 10 day average, the last day receives the same weight as the first day in the calculation. Each day’s price is assigned a 10% weighting. In a 5 day average, each day would have an equal 20% weighting. Some analysts believe that a heavier weighting should be given to the more recent price action.
> 
> **The Linearly Weighted Moving Average**
> 
> In an attempt to correct the weighting problem, some analysts employ a _linearly weighted moving average_. In this calculation, the closing price of the 10th day (in the case of a 10 day average) would be multiplied by 10, the ninth day by nine, the eighth day by eight, and so on. The greater weight is therefore given to the more recent closings. The total is then divided by the sum of the multipliers (55 in the case of the 10 day average: 10 + 9 + 8 +…+ 1). However, the linearly weighted average still does not address the problem of including only the price action covered by the length of the average itself.
> 
> **The Exponentially Smoothed Moving Average**
> 
> This type of average addresses both of the problems associated with the simple moving average. First, the exponentially smoothed average assigns a greater weight to the more recent data. Therefore, it is a weighted moving average. But while it assigns lesser importance to past price data, it does include in its calculation all of the data in the life of the instrument. In addition, the user is able to adjust the weighting to give greater or lesser weight to the most recent day’s price. This is done by assigning a percentage value to the last day’s price, which is added to a percentage of the previous day’s value. The sum of both percentage values adds up to 100. For example, the last day’s price could be assigned a value of 10% (.10), which is added to the previous day’s value of 90% (.90). That gives the last day 10% of the total weighting. That would be the equivalent of a 20 day average. By giving the last day’s price a smaller value of 5% (.05), lesser weight is given to the last day’s data and the average is less sensitive. That would be the equivalent of a 40 day moving average.
> 
> ...
> 
> The simple moving average is the one most commonly used by technicians, and is the one that we’ll be concentrating on. Some traders use just one moving average to generate trend signals. The moving average is plotted on the bar chart in its appropriate trading day along with that day’s price action. ***When the closing price moves above the moving average, a buy signal is generated. A sell signal is given when prices move below the moving average.*** For added confirmation, some technicians also like to see the moving average line itself turn in the direction of the price crossing.
> 
> If a very short term average is employed (a 5 or 10 day), the average tracks prices very closely and several crossings occur. This action can be either good or bad. The use of a very sensitive average produces more trades (with higher commission costs) and results in many false signals (whipsaws). If the average is too sensitive, some of the short term random price movement (or “noise”) activates bad trend signals.

> 
> While the shorter average generates more false signals, it has the advantage of giving trend signals earlier in the move. It stands to reason that the more sensitive the average, the earlier the signals will be. So there is a tradeoff at work here. The trick is to find the average that is sensitive enough to generate early signals, but insensitive enough to avoid most of the random “noise.”

> This technique is called the _double crossover method_. This means that a buy signal is produced when the shorter average crosses above the longer. For example, two popular combinations are the 5 and 20 day averages and the 10 and 50 day averages. In the former, a buy signal occurs when the 5 day average crosses above the 20, and a sell signal when the 5 day moves below the 20. In the latter example, the 10 day crossing above the 50 signals an uptrend, and a downtrend takes place with the 10 slipping under the 50. This technique of using two averages together lags the market a bit more than the use of a single average but produces fewer whipsaws.

> A buying alert takes place in a downtrend when the 4 day crosses above both the 9 and the 18. A confirmed buy signal occurs when the 9 day then crosses above the 18. This places the 4 day over the 9 day which is over the 18 day. Some intermingling may occur during corrections or consolidations, but the general uptrend remains intact. Some traders may take profits during the intermingling process and some may use it as a buying opportunity. There is obviously a lot of room for flexibility here in applying the rules, depending on how aggressively one wants to trade.

> _Percentage envelopes_ can be used to help determine when a market has gotten overextended in either direction. In other words, they tell us when prices have strayed too far from their moving average line. In order to do this, the envelopes are placed at fixed percentages above and below the average. Shorter term traders, for example, often use 3% envelopes around a simple 21 day moving average. When prices reach one of the envelopes (3% from the average), the short term trend is considered to be overextended. For long range analysis, some possible combinations include 5% envelopes around a 10 week average or a 10% envelope around a 40 week average.

> 
> ...
> 
> This technique was developed by John Bollinger. Two trading bands are placed around a moving average similar to the envelope technique. Except that _Bollinger Bands_ are placed two standard deviations above and below the moving average, which is usually 20 days. _Standard deviation_ is a statistical concept that describes how prices are dispersed around an average value. Using two standard deviations ensures that 95% of the price data will fall between the two trading bands. As a rule, prices are considered to be overextended on the upside (overbought) when they touch the upper band. They are considered overextended on the downside (oversold) when they touch the lower band.

> 
> ...
> 
> The simplest way to use Bollinger Bands is to use the upper and lower bands as price targets. In other words, if prices bounce off the lower band and cross above the 20 day average, the upper band becomes the upper price target. A crossing below the 20 day average would identify the lower band as the downside target. In a strong uptrend, prices will usually fluctuate between the upper band and the 20 day average. In that case, a crossing below the 20 day average warns of a trend reversal to the downside.
> 
> Bollinger Bands differ from envelopes in one major way. Whereas the envelopes stay a constant percentage width apart, Bollinger Bands expand and contract based on the last 20 days’ volatility. During a period of rising price volatility, the distance between the two bands will widen. Conversely, during a period of low market volatility, the distance between the two bands will contract. There is a tendency for the bands to alternate between expansion and contraction. When the bands are unusually far apart, that is often a sign that the current trend may be ending. When the distance between the two bands has narrowed too far, that is often a sign that a market may be about to initiate a new trend. Bollinger Bands can also be applied to weekly and monthly price charts by using _20 weeks_ and _20 months_ instead of _20 days_. Bollinger Bands work best when combined with overbought/oversold oscillators that are explained in the next chapter.

### Chapter 10. Oscillators and Contrary Opinion

> The oscillator is only a secondary indicator in the sense that it must be subordinated to basic trend analysis. As we go through the various types of oscillators used by technicians, the importance of trading in the direction of the overriding market trend will be constantly stressed. The reader should also be aware that there are times when oscillators are more useful than at others. For example, near the beginning of important moves, oscillator analysis isn’t that helpful and can even be misleading. Toward the end of market moves, however, oscillators become extremely valuable.
> 
> ... The oscillator band is basically flat while prices may be trading up, down, or sideways. However, the peaks and troughs in the oscillator coincide with the peaks and troughs on the price chart. Some oscillators have a midpoint value that divides the horizontal range into two halves, an upper and a lower. Depending on the formula used, this midpoint line is usually a _zero line_. Some oscillators also have upper and lower boundaries ranging from 0 to 100.
> 
> ...
> 
> There are three situations when the oscillator is most useful. You’ll see that these three situations are common to most types of oscillators that are used.
> 
> 1. The oscillator is most useful when its value reaches an extreme reading near the upper or lower end of its boundaries. The market is said to be _overbought_ when it is near the upper extreme and _oversold_ when it is near the lower extreme. This warns that the price trend is overextended and vulnerable.
> 
> 2. A divergence between the oscillator and the price action when the oscillator is in an extreme position is usually an important warning.
> 
> 3. The crossing of the zero (or midpoint) line can give important trading signals in the direction of the price trend.
> 
> ![Oscillators: 10 Day Momentum](/.attachments/oscillators.10.day.momentum.png)
> 
> _The 10 day momentum line fluctuates around a zero line. Readings too far above the zero line are overbought, while values too far below the line are oversold. Momentum should be used in conjunction with the trend of the market._
> 
> The concept of _momentum_ is the most basic application of oscillator analysis. Momentum measures the velocity of price changes as opposed to the actual price levels themselves. Market momentum is measured by continually taking price differences for a fixed time interval. To construct a 10 day momentum line, simply subtract the closing price 10 days ago from the last closing price. This positive or negative value is then plotted around a zero line. The formula for momentum is:
> 
> $M = V - V^x$
> 
> where V is the latest closing price and V x is the closing price x days ago.

> 
> _A comparison of 10 and 40 day momentum lines. The longer version is more helpful in catching major market turns (see circles)._
> 
> If the latest closing price is greater than that of 10 days ago (in other words, prices have moved higher), then a positive value would be plotted above the zero line. If the latest close is below the close 10 days earlier (prices have declined), then a negative value is plotted below the zero line.
> 
> While the 10 day momentum is a commonly used time period for reasons discussed later, any time period can be employed. A shorter time period (such as 5 days) produces a more sensitive line with more pronounced oscillations. A longer number of days (such as 40 days) results in a much smoother line in which the oscillator swings are less volatile.
> 
> ... By plotting price differences for a set period of time, the chartist is studying rates of ascent or descent. If prices are rising and the momentum line is above the zero line and rising, this means the uptrend is accelerating. If the up-slanting momentum line begins to flatten out, this means that the new gains being achieved by the latest closes are the same as the gains 10 days earlier. While prices may still be advancing, the rate of ascent (or the velocity) has leveled off. When the momentum line begins to drop toward the zero line, the uptrend in prices is still in force, but at a decelerating rate. The uptrend is losing momentum.
> 
> ...
> 
> Because of the way it is constructed, the momentum line is always a step ahead of the price movement. It leads the advance or decline in prices, then levels off while the current price trend is still in effect. It then begins to move in the opposite direction as prices begin to level off.
> 
> The momentum chart has a zero line. Many technicians use the crossing of the zero line to generate buy and sell signals. ***A crossing above the zero line would be a buy signal, and a crossing below the zero line, a sell signal***. It should be stressed here again, however, that basic trend analysis is still the overriding consideration. Oscillator analysis should not be used as an excuse to trade against the prevailing market trend. Buy positions should only be taken on crossings above the zero line if the market trend is up. Short positions should be taken on crossings below the zero line only if the price trend is down.
> 
> ![Oscillators: Trendlines](/.attachments/oscillators.trend.lines.png)

> _The trendlines on the momentum chart are broken sooner than those on the price chart. The value of the momentum indicator is that it turns sooner than the market itself, making it a leading indicator._

> _Some traders regard a crossing above the zero line as a buy signal and a crossing below the line as a sell signal (see circles). A moving average is helpful to confirm trend changes. The momentum line peaked before the price (see arrows)._
> 
> **MEASURING RATE OF CHANGE**
> 
> To measure the _rate of change_, a ratio is constructed of the most recent closing price to a price a certain number of days in the past. To construct a 10 day rate of change oscillator, the latest closing price is divided by the close 10 days ago. The formula is as follows:
> 
> $Rate of change = 100 (V/Vx)$
> 
> where V is the latest close and Vx is the closing price x days ago.
> 
> In this case, the 100 line becomes the midpoint line. If the latest price is higher than the price 10 days ago (prices are rising), the resulting rate of change value will be above 100. If the last close is below 10 days ago, the ratio would be below 100.
> 
> ...
> 
> The crossing of the shorter average above or below the longer average registered buy and sell signals, respectively. It was mentioned at that time that these dual moving average combinations could also be used to construct oscillator charts. This can be done by plotting the difference between the two averages as a histogram. These histogram bars appear as a plus or minus value around a centered zero line. This type of oscillator has three uses:
> 
> 1. To help spot divergences.
> 2. To help identify short term variations from the long term trend, when the shorter average moves too far above or below the longer average.
> 3. To pinpoint the crossings of the two moving averages, which occur when the oscillator crosses the zero line.
> 
> The shorter average is divided by the longer. In both cases, however, the shorter average oscillates around the longer average, which is in effect the zero line. If the shorter average is above the longer, the oscillator would be positive. A negative reading would be present if the shorter average were under the longer.
> 
> When the two moving average lines move too far apart, a market extreme is created calling for a pause in the trend. Very often, the trend remains stalled until the shorter average line moves back to the longer. When the shorter line approaches the longer, a critical point is reached. In an uptrend, for example, the shorter line dips back to the longer average, but should bounce off it. This usually represents an ideal buying area. It’s much like the testing of an up trendline. If the shorter average crosses below the longer average, however, a trend reversal is signaled.
>

> _The histogram lines measure the difference between the two moving averages. Crossing above and below the zero line give buy and sell signals (see arrows). Notice that the histogram turns well before the actual signals (see circles)._
> 
> ...
> 
> In a downtrend, a rise in the shorter average to the longer usually represents an ideal selling area unless the longer line is crossed, in which case a trend reversal signal would be registered. The relationships between the two averages can be used, therefore, not only as an excellent trend-following system, but also to help identify short term overbought and oversold conditions.
> 
> ...
> 
> **COMMODITY CHANNEL INDEX**
> 
> It is possible to normalize an oscillator by dividing the values by a constant divisor. In the construction of his Commodity Channel Index (CCI), Donald R. Lambert compares the current price with a moving average over a selected time span—usually 20 days. He then normalizes the oscillator values by using a divisor based on mean deviation. As a result, the CCI fluctuates in a constant range from +100 on the upside to -100 on the downside. Lambert recommended long positions in those markets with values over +100. Markets with CCI values below -100 were candidates for short sales.
> 
> It seems, however, that most chartists use CCI simply as an overbought/oversold oscillator. Used in that fashion readings over +100 are considered overbought and under -100 are oversold. While the Commodity Channel Index was originally developed for commodities, it is also used for trading stock index futures and options like the S&P 100 (OEX). Although 20 days is the common default value for CCI, the user can vary the number to adjust its sensitivity.

> 
> **RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX**
> 
> As Wilder points out, one of the two major problems in constructing a momentum line (using price differences) is the erratic movement often caused by sharp changes in the values being dropped off. A sharp advance or a decline 10 days ago (in the case of a 10 day momentum line) can cause sudden shifts in the momentum line even if the current prices show little change. Some smoothing is therefore necessary to minimize these distortions. The second problem is that there is the need for a constant range for comparison purposes. The RSI formula not only provides the necessary smoothing, but also solves the latter problem by creating a constant vertical range of 0 to 100.
> 
> The term “relative strength,” incidentally, is a misnomer and often causes confusion among those more familiar with that term as it is used in stock market analysis. Relative strength generally means a ratio line comparing two different entities. A ratio of a stock or industry group to the S&P 500 Index is one way of gauging the relative strength of different stocks or industry groups against one objective benchmark. We’ll show you later in the book how useful relative strength or ratio analysis can be. Wilder’s Relative Strength Index doesn’t really measure the relative strength between different entities and, in that sense, the name is somewhat misleading. The RSI, however, does solve the problem of erratic movement and the need for a constant upper and lower boundary. The actual formula is calculated as follows:
> 
> $RSI = 100 - {100 \over 1 + RS}$
> 
> $RS = {\text{Average of x days' up closes} \over \text{Average of x days' down closes} }$
> 
> Fourteen days are used in the calculation; 14 weeks are used for weekly charts. To find the average up value, add the total points gained on up days during the 14 days and divide that total by 14. To find the average down value, add the total number of points lost during the down days and divide that total by 14. Relative strength (RS) is then determined by dividing the _up_ average by the _down_ average. That RS value is then inserted into the formula for RSI. The number of days can be varied by simply changing the value of x.
> 
> Wilder originally employed a 14 day period. _The shorter the time period, the more sensitive the oscillator becomes and the wider its amplitude_. RSI works best when its fluctuations reach the upper and lower extremes. Therefore, if the user is trading on a very short term basis and wants the oscillator swings to be more pronounced, the time period can be shortened. The time period is lengthened to make the oscillator smoother and narrower in amplitude. The amplitude in the 9 day oscillator is therefore greater than the original 14 day. While 9 and 14 day spans are the most common values used, technicians experiment with other periods. Some use shorter lengths, such as 5 or 7 days, to increase the volatility of the RSI line. Others use 21 or 28 days to smooth out the RSI signals.

>

> 
> RSI is plotted on a vertical scale of 0 to 100. Movements above 70 are considered overbought, while an oversold condition would be a move under 30. Because of shifting that takes place in bull and bear markets, the 80 level usually becomes the overbought level in bull markets and the 20 level the oversold level in bear markets.
> 
> “Failure swings,” as Wilder calls them, occur when the RSI is above 70 or under 30. A _top failure swing_ occurs when a peak in the RSI (over 70) fails to exceed a previous peak in an uptrend, followed by a downside break of a previous trough. A _bottom failure swing_ occurs when the RSI is in a downtrend (under 30), fails to set a new low, and then proceeds to exceed a previous peak.

> 
> In my own personal experience with the RSI oscillator, its greatest value lies in failure swings or divergences that occur when the RSI is over 70 or under 30. Let’s clarify another important point on the use of oscillators. ***Any strong trend, either up or down, usually produces an extreme oscillator reading before too long. In such cases, claims that a market is overbought or oversold are usually premature and can lead to an early exit from a profitable trend. In strong uptrends, overbought markets can stay overbought for some time. Just because the oscillator has moved into the upper region is not reason enough to liquidate a long position (or, even worse, short into the strong uptrend)***.
> 
> The first move into the overbought or oversold region is usually just a warning. The signal to pay close attention to is the second move by the oscillator into the danger zone. If the second move fails to confirm the price move into new highs or new lows (forming a double top or bottom on the oscillator), a possible divergence exists. At that point, some defensive action can be taken to protect existing positions. If the oscillator moves in the opposite direction, breaking a previous high or low, then a divergence or failure swing is confirmed.
> 
> The 50 level is the RSI midpoint value, and will often act as support during pullbacks and resistance during bounces. Some traders treat RSI crossings above and below the 50 level as buying and selling signals respectively.

> 
> **STOCHASTICS (K%D)**
> 
> The _Stochastic_ oscillator was popularized by George Lane (president of Investment Educators, Inc., Watseka, IL). It is based on the observation that as prices increase, closing prices tend to be closer to the upper end of the price range. Conversely, in downtrends, the closing price tends to be near the lower end of the range. Two lines are used in the Stochastic Process—the %K line and the %D line. The %D line is the more important and is the one that provides the major signals.
> 
> The intent is to determine where the most recent closing price is in relation to the price range for a chosen time period. Fourteen is the most common period used for this oscillator. To determine the K line, which is the more sensitive of the two, the formula is:

> $\%K = 100 {[{(C - L14)} / {(H14 - L14)}]}$

> where $C$ is the latest close, $L14$ is the lowest low for the last 14 periods, and $H14$ is the highest high for the same 14 periods (14 periods can refer to days, weeks, or months).
> 
> The formula simply measures, on a percentage basis of 0 to 100, where the closing price is in relation to the total price range for a selected time period. A very high reading (over 80) would put the closing price near the top of the range, while a low reading (under 20) near the bottom of the range.
> 
> The second line (%D) is a 3 period moving average of the %K line. This formula produces a version called fast stochastics. By taking another 3 period average of %D, a smoother version called slow stochastics is computed. Most traders use the slow stochastics because of its more reliable signals.
> 
> These formulas produce two lines that oscillate between a vertical scale from 0 to 100. The K line is a faster line, while the D line is a slower line. The major signal to watch for is a divergence between the D line and the price of the underlying market when the D line is in an overbought or oversold area. The upper and lower extremes are the 80 and 20 values.
> 
> A bearish divergence occurs when the D line is over 80 and forms two declining peaks while prices continue to move higher. A bullish divergence is present when the D line is under 20 and forms two rising bottoms while prices continue to move lower. Assuming all of these factors are in place, the actual buy or sell signal is triggered when the faster K line crosses the slower D line.
> 
> There are other refinements in the use of Stochastics, but this explanation covers the more essential points. Despite the higher level of sophistication, the basic oscillator interpretation remains the same. An alert or set-up is present when the %D line is in an extreme area and diverging from the price action. The actual signal takes place when the D line is crossed by the faster K line.
> 
> The Stochastic oscillator can be used on weekly and monthly charts for longer range perspective. It can also be used effectively on intraday charts for shorter term trading.
> 
> One way to combine daily and weekly stochastics is to use weekly signals to determine market direction and daily signals for timing. It’s also a good idea to combine stochastics with RSI.

> 
> Larry Williams %R is based on a similar concept of measuring the latest close in relation to its price range over a given number of days. Today’s close is subtracted from the price high of the range for a given number of days and that difference is divided by the total range for the same period. The concepts already discussed for oscillator interpretation are applied to %R as well, with the main factors being the presence of divergences in overbought or oversold areas. Since %R is subtracted from the high, it looks like an upside down stochastics. To correct that, charting packages plot an inverted version of %R.

> 
> Oscillator lengths can be tied to underlying market cycles. A time period of 1/2 the cycle length is used. Popular time inputs are 5, 10, and 20 days based on calendar day periods of 14, 28, and 56 days. Wilder’s RSI uses 14 days, which is half of 28. In the previous chapter, we discussed some reasons why the numbers 5, 10, and 20 keep cropping up in moving average and oscillator formulations, so we won’t repeat them here. Suffice it to mention here that 28 calendar days (20 trading days) represent an important dominant monthly trading cycle and that the other numbers are related harmonically to that monthly cycle. The popularity of the 10 day momentum and the 14 day RSI lengths are based largely on the 28 day trading cycle and measure 1/2 of the value of that dominant trading cycle.

However, the reader is cautioned against placing too much importance on divergence analysis to the point where basic trend analysis is either ignored or overlooked.

The place to start your market analysis is always by determining the general trend of the market. If the trend is up, then a buying strategy is called for. Oscillators can then be used to help time market entry. ***Buy when the market is oversold in an uptrend. Sell short when the market is overbought in a downtrend***. Or, buy when the momentum oscillator crosses back above the zero line when the major trend is bullish and sell a crossing under the zero line in a bear market.
> 
> The importance of trading in the direction of the major trend cannot be overstated. The danger in placing too much importance on oscillators by themselves is the temptation to use divergence as an excuse to initiate trades contrary to the general trend. This action generally proves a costly and painful exercise. The oscillator, as useful as it is, is just one tool among many others and must always be used as an aid, not a substitute, for basic trend analysis.
> 
> There are times when oscillators are more useful than at others. ***During choppy market periods, as prices move sideways for several weeks or months, oscillators track the price movement very closely***. The peaks and troughs on the price chart coincide almost exactly with the peaks and troughs on the oscillator. Because both price and oscillator are moving sideways, they look very much alike. At some point, however, a price breakout occurs and a new uptrend or downtrend begins. By its very nature, the oscillator is already in an extreme position just as the breakout is taking place. If the breakout is to the upside, the oscillator is already overbought. An oversold reading usually accompanies a downside breakout. The trader is faced with a dilemma. Should he or she buy the bullish breakout in the face of an overbought oscillator reading? Should the downside breakout be sold into an oversold market?
> 
> In such cases, the oscillator is best ignored for the time being and the position taken. The reason for this is that in the early stages of a new trend, following an important breakout, oscillators often reach extremes very quickly and stay there for awhile. Basic trend analysis should be the main consideration at such times, with oscillators given a lesser role. Later on, as the trend begins to mature, the oscillator should be given greater weight. Many dynamic bull moves have been missed by traders who saw the major trend signal, but decided to wait for their oscillators to move into an oversold condition before buying. To summarize, ***give less attention to the oscillator in the early stages of an important move, but pay close attention to its signals as the move reaches maturity***.
> 
> **MOVING AVERAGE CONVERGENCE/DIVERGENCE**
> 
> We mentioned in the previous chapter an oscillator technique that uses 2 exponential moving averages and here it is. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator, or simply MACD, was developed by Gerald Appel. What makes this indicator so useful is that it combines some of the oscillator principles we’ve already explained with a dual moving average crossover approach. You’ll see only two lines on your computer screen although three lines are actually used in its calculation. The faster line (called the MACD line) is the difference between two exponentially smoothed moving averages of closing prices (usually the last 12 and 26 days or weeks). The slower line (called the signal line) is usually a 9 period exponentially smoothed average of the MACD line. Appel originally recommended one set of numbers for buy signals and another for sell signals. Most traders, however, utilize the default values of 12, 26, and 9 in all instances. That would include daily and weekly values.
> 
> ![Oscillators: MACD](/.attachments/oscillators.macd.png)
> 
> _The Moving Average Convergence Divergence system shows two lines. A signal is given when the faster MACD line crosses the slower signal line. The arrows show five trading signals on this chart of the Nasdaq Composite Index._
> 
> The actual buy and sell signals are given when the two lines cross. A crossing by the faster MACD line above the slower signal line is a buy signal. A crossing by the faster line below the slower is a sell signal. In that sense, MACD resembles a dual moving average crossover method. However, the MACD values also fluctuate above and below a zero line. That’s where it begins to resemble an oscillator. An overbought condition is present when the lines are too far above the zero line. An oversold condition is present when the lines are too far below the zero line. The best buy signals are given when prices are well below the zero line (oversold). Crossings above and below the zero line are another way to generate buy and sell signals respectively, similar to the momentum technique we discussed previously.
> 
> Divergences appear between the trend of the MACD lines and the price line. A negative, or bearish, divergence exists when the MACD lines are well above the zero line (overbought) and start to weaken while prices continue to trend higher. That is often a warning of a market top. A positive, or bullish, divergence exists when the MACD lines are well below the zero line (oversold) and start to move up ahead of the price line. That is often an early sign of a market bottom. Simple trendlines can be drawn on the MACD lines to help identify important trend changes.
> 
> ![Oscillators: MACD Line](/.attachments/oscillators.macd.line.png)
> 
> _The MACD lines fluctuate around a zero line, giving it the quality of an oscillator. The best buy signals occur below the zero line. The best sell signals come from above. Notice the negative divergence given in October (see down arrow)._
> 
> ...
> 
> As with all technical indicators, signals on weekly charts are always more important than those on daily charts. ***The best way to combine them is to use weekly signals to determine market direction and the daily signals to fine-tune entry and exit points. A daily signal is followed only when it agrees with the weekly signal***. Used in that fashion, the weekly signals become trend filters for daily signals. That prevents using daily signals to trade against the prevailing trend. Two crossover systems in which this principle is especially true are MACD and Stochastics.

> **THE PRINCIPLE OF CONTRARY OPINION ...**
> 
> ... ***Contrary Opinion, although it is generally listed under the category of technical analysis, is more aptly described as a form of psychological analysis***. ...
> 
> The principle of _Contrary Opinion_ holds that when the vast majority of people agree on anything, they are generally wrong. A true contrarian, therefore, will first try to determine what the majority are doing and then will act in the opposite direction.
> 
> ...
> 
> Consider the case of an individual speculator. Assume that speculator reads his or her favorite newsletter and becomes convinced that a market is about to move substantially higher. The more bullish the forecast, the more aggressively that trader will approach the market. Once that individual speculator’s funds are fully committed to that particular market, however, he or she is overbought—meaning there are no more funds to commit to the market.
>
> Expanding this situation to include all market participants, ***if 80-90% of market traders are bullish on a market, it is assumed that they have already taken their market positions. Who is left to buy and push the market higher?*** This then is one of the keys to understanding Contrary Opinion. If the overwhelming sentiment of market traders is on one side of the market, there simply isn’t enough buying or selling pressure left to continue the present trend.
> 
> ...
> 
> Let’s consider a few additional points that should be kept in mind when using these numbers. The norm or equilibrium point is at 55%. This allows for a built-in bullish bias on the part of the general public. The upper extreme is considered to be 90% and the lower extreme, 20%. Here again, the numbers are shifted upward slightly to allow for the bullish bias.
> 
> A contrarian position can usually be considered when the bullish consensus numbers are above 90% or under 20%. Readings over 75% or under 25% are also considered warning zones and suggest that a turn may be near. However, it is generally advisable to await a change in the trend of the numbers before taking action against the trend. A change in the direction of the Bullish Consensus numbers, especially if it occurs from one of the danger zones, should be watched closely.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Contrary Opinion works better when most of the open interest is held by speculators, who are considered to be weaker hands. It is not advisable to trade against large hedging interests.
> 
> ***Watch the market’s reaction to fundamental news very closely. The failure of prices to react to bullish news in an overbought area is a clear warning that a turn may be near.*** The first adverse news is usually enough to quickly push prices in the other direction. Correspondingly, the failure of prices in an oversold area (under 25%) to react to bearish news can be taken as a warning that all the bad news has been fully discounted in the current low price. Any bullish news will push prices higher.
> 
> As a general rule, trade in the same direction as the trend of the consensus numbers until an extreme is reached, at which time the numbers should be monitored for a sign of a change in trend. It goes without saying that standard technical analytical tools can and should also be employed to help identify market turns at these critical times. The breaking of support or resistance levels, trendlines, or moving averages can be utilized to help confirm that the trend is in fact turning. Divergences on oscillator charts are especially useful when the Bullish Consensus numbers are overbought or oversold.
> 
> **INVESTOR SENTIMENT READINGS**
> 
> Each weekend _Barron’s_ includes in its Market Laboratory section a set of numbers under the heading “Investor Sentiment Readings.” In that space, four different investor polls are included to gauge the degree of bullishness and bearishness in the stock market. The figures are given for the latest week and the period two and three weeks back for comparison purposes. Here’s a random sample of what the latest week’s figures might look like. Remember that these numbers are contrary indicators. ***Too much bullishness is bad. Too much bearishness is good.***

### Chapter 11. Point and Figure Charting

> _The point and figure chart is a study of pure price movement_. That is to say, it does not take time into consideration while plotting the price action. A bar chart, by contrast, combines both price and time. Because of the way the bar chart is constructed, the vertical axis is the price scale and the horizontal axis, a time scale. On a daily chart, for example, each successive day’s price action moves one space or bar to the right. This happens even if prices saw little or no change for that day. Something must always be placed in the next space. On the point and figure chart, only the price changes are recorded. If no price change occurs, the chart is left untouched. During active market periods, a considerable amount of plotting may be required. During quiet market conditions, little or no plotting will be needed.
> 
> An important difference is the treatment of volume. Bar charts record volume bars under the day’s price action. Point and figure charts ignore volume numbers, as a separate entity. This last phrase, “as a separate entity,” is an important one. Although the volume numbers are not recorded on the point and figure chart, it does not necessarily follow that volume, or trading activity, is totally lost. On the contrary, since intraday point and figure charts record all price change activity, the heavier or lighter volume is reflected in the amount of price changes recorded on the chart. Because volume is one of the more important ingredients in determining the potency of support and resistance levels, point and figure charts become especially useful in determining at which price levels most of the trading activity took place and, hence, where the important support and resistance numbers are.

> 
> Correspondingly, when a column of o’s declines one box under a previous column of o’s, a downside breakout occurs. Notice how much more precise these breakouts are than those on the bar chart. These breakouts can, of course, be used as buy and sell signals. We’ll have more to say on buy and sell signals a bit later. But the charts demonstrate one of the advantages of the point and figure chart, mainly the greater precision and ease in recognizing trend signals.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Let’s construct an intraday chart using some actual price data.
> 
> The following numbers describe 9 actual days of trading in a Swiss franc futures contract. The box size is 5 points. Therefore, every 5 point swing in either direction is plotted. We’ll start with a 1 box reversal chart.
> 
> Let’s begin on the left side of the chart. First the chart is scaled to reflect a 5 point increment for every box.
> 
> Column 1: Put a dot at 4875. Because the next number—4880—is higher, fill in the next box up to 4880.
> 
> Column 2: The next number is 4860. Move 1 column to the right, go down 1 box, and fill in all the o’s down to 4860.
> 
> Column 3: The next number is 4865. Move 1 column to the right, move up 1 box and put an x at 4865. Stop here. So far you have only 1 x marked in column 3 because prices have only moved up 1 box. On a 1 box reversal chart, there must always be at least 2 boxes filled in each column. Notice that the next number is 4850, calling for o’s down to that number. Do you go to the next column to record the column of declining o’s? The answer is no because that would leave only 1 mark, the x, in column 3. Therefore, in the column with the lone x (column 3) fill in o’s down to 4850.
> 
> Column 4: The next number is 4860. Move to the next column, move 1 box up, and plot in the x’s up to 4860.
> 
> Column 5: The next number is 4855. Because this is a move down, go to the next column, move down a box, and fill the o at 4860. Notice on the table that this is the last price of the day. Let’s do one more.
> 
> Column 6: The first number on 5/2 is 4870. So far, you only have one o in column 5. You must have at least 2 marks in each column. Therefore, fill in x’s (because prices are advancing) up to 4870. But notice that the last price on the previous day is blacked out. This is to help keep track of time. By blacking in the last price each day, it’s much easier to keep track of the separate days’ trading.

> 
> _A 5×1 point and figure chart of a Deutsche mark contract is shown in the upper chart. The blackened boxes show the end of each day’s trading._
> 
> Feel free to continue through the remainder of the chart to sharpen your understanding of the plotting process. Notice that this chart has several columns where both x’s and o’s are present. This situation will only develop on the 1 point reversal chart and is caused by the necessity of having at least 2 boxes filled in each column. Some purists might argue with combining the x’s and o’s. Experience will show, however, that this method of plotting prices makes it much easier to follow the order of the transactions.
> 
> ...
> 
> One principal advantage of the intraday 1 box reversal chart is the ability to obtain price objectives through use of the _horizontal count_. If you think back to our coverage of bar charts and price patterns, the question of price objectives was discussed. However, virtually all methods of obtaining price objectives off bar charts were based on what we call _vertical measurements_. This meant measuring the height of a pattern (the volatility) and projecting that distance upward or downward. For example, the head and shoulders pattern measured the distance from the head to the neckline and swung that objective from the break of that neckline.
> 
> As you can see, they’re not much different from ones already discussed on bar charting. Most of the patterns are variations on the double and triple tops and bottoms, head and shoulders, V’s and inverted V’s, and saucers. The term “fulcrum” shows up quite a bit in the point and figure literature. Essentially, the fulcrum is a well defined congestion area, occurring after a significant advance or decline, that forms an accumulation base or a distribution top. In a base, for example, the bottom of the area is subjected to repeated tests, interrupted by intermittent rally attempts. Very often, the fulcrum takes on the appearance of a double or triple bottom. The basing pattern is completed when a breakout (catapult) occurs over the top of the congestion area.

> 
> Those reversal patterns with the most pronounced horizontal ranges obviously lend themselves quite well to the taking of count measurements. The V base, in contrast, because of the absence of a significant horizontal price area, would not be amenable to the taking of a horizontal count. The blackened boxes in the chart examples represent suggested buying and selling points. Notice that those entry points generally coincide with the retesting of support areas in a base or resistance areas in a top, breakout points, and the breaking of trendlines.
> 
> Trendline analysis on intraday charts is the same as that applied to bar charts. Up trendlines are drawn under successive lows and down trendlines are drawn over successive peaks. This is not true of the simplified point and figure chart ... It utilizes 45 degree lines and plots them differently.
> 
> ...
> 
> These are your basic up and down trendlines. Because of the severe condensation on these charts, it would be impractical to try to connect rally tops or reaction lows. The 45 degree line is, therefore, used. In an uptrend, _the bullish support line_ is drawn at a _45 degree angle_ upward to the right from under the lowest column of o’s. As long as prices remain above that line, the major trend is considered to be bullish. In a downtrend, the bearish resistance line is drawn at a 45 degree angle downward to the right from the top of the highest column of x’s. As long as prices remain below that down trendline, the trend is bearish.

> 
> At times, those lines may have to be adjusted. For example, sometimes a correction in an uptrend breaks below the rising support line after which the uptrend resumes. In such cases, a new support line must be drawn at a 45 degree angle from the bottom of that reaction low. Sometimes a trend is so strong that the original up trendline is simply too far away from the price action. In that case, a tighter trendline should be drawn in an attempt to arrive at a “best fitting” support line.

> 1. A simple buy signal can be used for the covering of old shorts and/or the initiation of new longs.
> 2. A simple sell signal can be used for the liquidation of old longs and/or the initiation of new shorts.
> 3. The simple signal can be used only for liquidation purposes with a complex formation needed for a new commitment.
> 4. The trendline can be used as a filter. Long positions are taken above the trendline and short positions below the trendline.
> 5. For stop protection, always risk below the last column of o’s in an uptrend and over the last column of x’s in a downtrend.
> 6. The actual entry point can be varied as follows:
>    1. Buy the actual breakout in an uptrend.
>    2. Buy a 3 box reversal after the breakout occurs to obtain a lower entry point.
>    3. Buy a 3 box reversal in the direction of the original breakout after a correction occurs. Not only does this require the added confirmation of a positive reversal in the right direction, but a closer stop point can now be used under the latest column of o’s.
>    4. Buy a second breakout in the same direction as the original breakout signal.
>
> As you can readily see from the list, there are many different ways that the point and figure chart can be used. Once the basic technique is understood, there is almost unlimited flexibility as to how to best enter and exit a market using this approach.
> 
> The actual buy or sell signal occurs on the first signal. However, as the move continues, several other signals appear on the chart. These repeat buy or sell signals can be used for additional positions. Whether or not this is done, the protective stop point can be raised to just below the latest o column in an uptrend and lowered to just over the latest x column in a downtrend. This use of a _trailing_ stop allows the trader to stay with the position and protect accumulated profits at the same time.

In addition, you can vary the box and reversal sizes with a keystroke to adjust the chart for shorter or longer term analysis. You can construct p&f charts from real-time (intraday) and end of day data, and you can apply them to any market you want. But you can do a lot more with a computer.

### Chapter 12. Japanese Candlesticks

> Charting market data in candlestick form uses the same data available for standard bar charts; open, high, low, and close prices. While using the exact same data, candlestick charts offer a much more visually appealing chart. Information seems to jump off the page (computer screen). The information displayed is more easily interpreted and analyzed. The box below is a depiction of of a single day of prices showing the difference between the bar (left) and the candlestick(s).
> 
> ![Candlesticks: The Candlestick](/.attachments/candlesticks-the.candlestick.png)
> 
> You can see how the name “candlesticks” came about. They look somewhat like a candle with a wick. The rectangle represents the difference between the open and close price for the day, and is called the _body_. Notice that the body can be either black or white. A _white body_ means that the close price was greater (higher) than the open price. Actually, the body is not white, but open (not filled), which makes it work better with computers. This is so that it will print correctly when printing charts on a computer. This is one of the adaptations that have occurred in the West; the Japanese use red for the open body. The _black body_ means that the close price was lower than the open price. The open and close prices are given much significance in Japanese candlesticks. The small lines above and below the body are referred to as _wicks_ or _hairs_ or _shadows_. Many different names for these lines appear in Japanese reference literature, which is odd since they represent the high and low prices for the day and are normally not considered vital in the analysis by the Japanese.
> 
> ...
> 
> Different body/shadow combinations have different meanings. Days in which the difference between the open and close prices is great are called _Long Days_. Likewise, days in which the difference between the open and close price is small, are called _Short Days_. Remember, we are only talking about the size of the body and no reference is made to the high and/or low prices.

> **CANDLE PATTERN ANALYSIS**
> 
> A Japanese candle pattern is a psychological depiction of traders’ mentality at the time. It vividly shows the actions of the traders as time unfolds in the market. The mere fact that humans react consistently during similar situations makes candle pattern analysis work.
> 
> A Japanese candle pattern can consist of a single candlestick line or be a combination of multiple lines, normally never more than five. While most candle patterns are used to determine reversal points in the market, there are a few that are used to determine trend continuation. They are referred to as reversal and continuation patterns. Whenever a reversal pattern has bullish implications, an inversely related pattern has bearish meaning. Similarly, whenever a continuation pattern has bullish implications, an opposite pattern gives bearish meaning. When there is a pair of patterns that work in both bullish and bearish situations, they usually have the same name. In a few cases, however, the bullish pattern and its bearish counterpart have completely different names.
> 
> ...
> 
> **FILTERED CANDLE PATTERNS**
> 
> A revolutionary concept developed by Greg Morris in 1991, called candle pattern filtering, provides a simple method to improve the overall reliability of candle patterns. While the short term trend of the market must be identified before a candle pattern can exist, determination of overbought and oversold markets using traditional technical analysis will enhance a candle pattern’s predictive ability. Concurrently, this technique helps eliminate bad or premature candle patterns.
> 
> One must first grasp how a traditional technical indicator responds to price data. In this example, Stochastics %D will be used. The stochastic indicator oscillates between 0 and 100, with 20 being oversold and 80 being overbought. The primary interpretation for this indicator is when %D rises above 80 and then falls below 80, a sell signal has been generated. Similarly, when it drops below 20 and then rises above 20, a buy signal is given.
> 
> Here is what we know about stochastics %D: When it enters the area above 80 or below 20, it will eventually generate a signal. In other words, it is just a matter of time until a signal is given. The area above 80 and below 20 is called the presignal area and represents the area that %D must get to before it can give a trading signal of its own.
> 
> ![Candlesticks: Pairing with Stochastic Oscillator](/.attachments/candlesticks-pairing.candlesticks.with.stochastic.oscillator.png)
> 
> The filtered candle pattern concept uses this presignal area. Candle patterns are considered only when %D is in its presignal area. If a candle pattern occurs when stochastics %D is at, say 65, the pattern is ignored. Also, only reversal candle patterns are considered using this concept.
> 
> Candle pattern filtering is not limited to using stochastics %D. Any technical oscillator that you might normally use for analysis can be used to filter candle patterns. Wilder’s RSI, Lambert’s CCI, and Williams’ %R are a few that will work equally as well.

### Chapter 13. Elliott Wave Theory

> There are three important aspects of wave theory—_pattern_, _ratio_, and _time_—in that order of importance. _Pattern_ refers to the wave patterns or formations that comprise the most important element of the theory. _Ratio analysis_ is useful in determining retracement points and price objectives by measuring the relationships between the different waves. Finally, _time_ relationships also exist and can be used to confirm the wave patterns and ratios, but are considered by some Elliotticians to be less reliable in market forecasting.
> 
> Elliott Wave Theory was originally applied to the major stock market averages, particularly the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In its most basic form, the theory says that the stock market follows a repetitive rhythm of a five wave advance followed by a three wave decline.
> 
> ![Elliot Wave Theory: Basic Pattern](/.attachments/elliot.wave.theory-basic.pattern.png)
> 
> _The Basic Pattern. (A.J. Frost and Robert Prechter, Elliott Wave Principle [Gainesville, GA: New Classics Library, 1978], p. 20. Copyright © 1978 by Frost and Prechter.)_
> 
> If you count the waves, you will find that one complete cycle has eight waves—five up and three down. In the advancing portion of the cycle, notice that each of the five waves are numbered. Waves 1, 3, and 5—called _impulse_ waves—are rising waves, while waves 2 and 4 move against the uptrend. Waves 2 and 4 are called _corrective_ waves because they correct waves 1 and 3. After the five wave numbered advance has been completed, a three wave correction begins. The three corrective waves are identified by the letters a, b, c.
> 
> Along with the constant form of the various waves, there is the important consideration of degree. There are many different degrees of trend. Elliott, in fact, categorized nine different degrees of trend (or magnitude) ranging from a _Grand Supercycle_ spanning two hundred years to a _subminuette_ degree covering only a few hours. The point to remember is that the basic eight wave cycle remains constant no matter what degree of trend is being studied.
> 
> Each wave subdivides into waves of one lesser degree that, in turn, can also be subdivided into waves of even lesser degree. It also follows then that each wave is itself part of the wave of the next higher degree.
> 
> ![Elliot Wave Theory: 34 Waves](/.attachments/elliot.wave.theory-34.waves.png)
> 
> _(Frost and Prechter, p. 21. Copyright © 1978 by Frost and Prechter.)_
> 
> The largest two waves—1 and 2—can be subdivided into eight lesser waves that, in turn, can be subdivided into 34 even lesser waves. The two largest waves—1 and 2—are only the first two waves in an even larger five wave advance. Wave 3 of that next higher degree is about to begin.
> 
> The numbers shown so far 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144—are not just random numbers. They are part of the _Fibonacci number sequence_, which forms the mathematical basis for the Elliott Wave Theory. ... Whether a given wave divides into five waves or three waves is determined by the direction of the next larger wave. ...
> 
> Being able to determine between threes and fives is obviously of tremendous importance in the application of this approach. That information tells the analyst what to expect next. A completed five wave move, for example, usually means that only part of a larger wave has been completed and that there’s more to come (unless it’s a fifth of a fifth). _One of the most important rules to remember is that a correction can never take place in five waves_. In a bull market, for example, if a five wave decline is seen, this means that it is probably only the first wave of a three wave (a-b-c) decline and that there’s more to come on the downside. In a bear market, a three wave advance should be followed by resumption of the downtrend. A five wave rally would warn of a more substantial move to the upside and might possibly even be the first wave of a new bull trend.

> So far, we’ve talked mainly about the impulse waves in the direction of the major trend. Let’s turn our attention now to the corrective waves. In general, corrective waves are less clearly defined and, as a result, tend to be more difficult to identify and predict. One point that is clearly defined, however, is that corrective waves can never take place in five waves. Corrective waves are threes, never fives (with the exception of triangles). We’re going to look at three classifications of corrective waves—zig-zags, flats, and triangles.

> **Triangles**
> 
> Triangles usually occur in the fourth wave and precede the final move in the direction of the major trend. (They can also appear in the b wave of an a-b-c correction.) In an uptrend, therefore, it can be said that triangles are both bullish and bearish. They’re bullish in the sense that they indicate resumption of the uptrend. They’re bearish because they also indicate that after one more wave up, prices will probably peak.

> 
> Elliott’s interpretation of the triangle parallels the classical use of the pattern, but with his usual added precision. Remember from Chapter 6 that the triangle is usually a continuation pattern, which is exactly what Elliott said. Elliott’s triangle is a sideways consolidation pattern that breaks down into five waves, each wave in turn having three waves of its own. Elliott also classifies four different kinds of triangles—_ascending_, _descending_, _symmetrical_, and _expanding_—all of which were seen in Chapter 6.
> 
> Because chart patterns in commodity futures contracts sometimes don’t form as fully as they do in the stock market, it is not unusual for triangles in the futures markets to have only three waves instead of five. (Remember, however, that the minimum requirement for a triangle is still four points—two upper and two lower—to allow the drawing of two converging trendlines.) Elliott Wave Theory also holds that the fifth and last wave within the triangle sometimes breaks its trendline, giving a false signal, before beginning its “thrust” in the original direction.
> 
> Elliott’s measurement for the fifth and final wave after completion of the triangle is essentially the same as in classical charting—that is, the market is expected to move the distance that matches the widest part of the triangle (its height). There is another point worth noting here concerning the timing of the final top or bottom. According to Prechter, the apex of the triangle (the point where the two converging trendlines meet) often marks the timing for the completion of the final fifth wave.
> 
> **THE RULE OF ALTERNATION**
> 
> In its more general application, this rule or principle holds that the market usually doesn’t act the same way two times in a row. If a certain type of top or bottom occurred the last time around, it will probably not do so again this time. The rule of alternation doesn’t tell us exactly what will happen, but tells us what probably won’t. In its more specific application, it is most generally used to tell us what type of corrective pattern to expect. Corrective patterns tend to alternate. In other words, if corrective wave 2 was a simple a-b-c pattern, wave 4 will probably be a complex pattern, such as a triangle. Conversely, if wave 2 is complex, wave 4 will probably be simple.

> 
> 
> **CHANNELING**
> 
> Another important aspect of wave theory is the use of _price channels_. You’ll recall that we covered trend channeling in Chapter 4. Elliott used price channels as a method of arriving at price objectives and also to help confirm the completion of wave counts. Once an uptrend has been established, an initial trend channel is constructed by drawing a basic up trendline along the bottoms of waves 1 and 2. A parallel channel line is then drawn over the top of wave 1 ... The entire uptrend will often stay within those two boundaries.
> 
> ![Elliot Wave Theory: ](/.attachments/elliot.wave.theory-channels.png)
> 
> _Old and New Channels. (Frost and Prechter, p. 62. Copyright © 1978 by Frost and Prechter.)_
> 
> If wave 3 begins to accelerate to the point that it exceeds the upper channel line, the lines have to be redrawn along the top of wave 1 and the bottom of wave 2 ... The final channel is drawn under the two corrective waves—2 and 4—and usually above the top of wave 3 ... If wave 3 is unusually strong, or an extended wave, the upper line may have to be drawn over the top of wave 1. The fifth wave should come close to the upper channel line before terminating. For the drawing of channel lines on long term trends, it’s recommended that semilog charts be employed along with arithmetic charts.

> 
> **WAVE 4 AS A SUPPORT AREA**
> 
> In concluding our discussion of wave formations and guidelines, one important point remains to be mentioned, and that is the significance of wave 4 as a support area in subsequent bear markets. Once five up waves have been completed and a bear trend has begun, that bear market will usually not move below the previous fourth wave of one lesser degree; that is, the last fourth wave that was formed during the previous bull advance. There are exceptions to that rule, but usually the bottom of the fourth wave contains the bear market. This piece of information can prove very useful in arriving at a maximum downside price objective.

> It is important to keep in mind that wave theory was originally meant to be applied to the stock market averages. It doesn’t work as well in individual common stocks. It’s quite possible that it doesn’t work that well in some of the more thinly traded futures markets as well because mass psychology is one of the important foundations on which the theory rests. Gold, as an illustration, is an excellent vehicle for wave analysis because of its wide following.

### Chapter 14. Time Cycles

> ...
>
> It seems clear then that all phases of technical analysis depend to some extent on time considerations. Yet those considerations are not really applied in a consistent and dependable manner. That’s where time cycles come into play. Instead of playing a secondary or supporting role in market movement, cyclic analysts hold that time cycles are the determining factor in bull and bear markets. Not only is time the dominant factor, but all other technical tools can be improved by incorporating cycles. Moving averages and oscillators, for example, can be optimized by tying them to dominant cycles. Trendline analysis can be made more precise with cyclic analysis by determining which are valid trendlines and which are not. Price pattern analysis can be enhanced if combined with cyclic peaks and troughs. By the use of “time windows,” price movement can be filtered in such a way that extraneous action can be ignored and primary emphasis placed only on such times when important cycle tops and bottoms are due to occur.
> 
> **CYCLES**
> 
> The most intriguing book I’ve ever read on the subject of cycles was written by Edward R. Dewey, one of the pioneers of cyclic analysis, with Og Mandino entitled _Cycles: The Mysterious Forces That Trigger Events_. Thousands of seemingly unrelated cycles were isolated spanning hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of years. Everything from the 9.6 year cycle in Atlantic salmon abundance to the 22.20 year cycle in international battles from 1415 to 1930 was tracked. An average cycle of sunspot activity since 1527 was found to be 11.11 years. Several economic cycles, including the 18.33 year cycle in real estate activity and a 9.2 year stock market cycle, were presented.

> 
> Two startling conclusions are discussed by Dewey. First, that many of the cycles of seemingly unrelated phenomena clustered around similar periods. On p. 188 of his book, Dewey listed 37 different examples of the 9.6 year cycle, including caterpillar abundance in New Jersey, coyote abundance in Canada, wheat acreage in the U.S., and cotton prices in the U.S. Why should such unrelated activities show the same cycles?
> 
> The second discovery was that these similar cycles acted in synchrony, that is, they turned at the same time. ... including marriages, immigration, and stock prices in the U.S. Dewey’s startling conclusion was that something “out there” in the universe must be causing these cycles; that there seemed to be a sort of pulse to the universe that accounted for the pervasive presence of these cycles throughout so many areas of human existence.

> In 1941, Dewey organized the Foundation for the Study of Cycles (900 W. Valley Rd., Suite 502, Wayne, PA 19087). It is the oldest organization engaged in cycles research and the recognized leader in the field. The Foundation publishes _Cycles_ magazine, which presents research in many different areas including economics and business. It also publishes a monthly report, _Cycle Projections_, which applies cyclical analysis to stocks, commodities, real estate and the economy.
> 
> In 1970, J.M. Hurst authored _The Profit Magic of Stock Transaction Timing_. Although it deals mainly with stock market cycles, this book represents one of the best explanations of cycle theory available in print, and is highly recommended reading. The following diagrams are derived from Hurst’s original work.

> 
> Hurst also addresses how moving averages can be made more useful if their lengths are synchronized with dominant cycle lengths. Students of traditional charting techniques should gain additional insight into how these popular chart pictures form and maybe even why they work by reading Hurst’s chapter, entitled “Verify Your Chart Patterns.”
> 
> There are many different cycles affecting the financial markets. The only ones of real value for forecasting purposes are the _dominant cycles_. Dominant cycles are those that consistently affect prices and that can be clearly identified. Most futures markets have at least five dominant cycles. In an earlier chapter on the use of long term charts, it was stressed that ***all technical analysis should begin with the long term picture, gradually working toward the shorter term***. That principle holds true in the study of cycles. The proper procedure is to begin the analysis with a study of long term dominant cycles, which can span several years; then work toward the intermediate, which can be several weeks to several months; finally, the very short term cycles, from several hours to several days, can be used for timing of entry and exit points and to help confirm the turning points of the longer cycles.
> 
> The general categories are: _long term cycles_ (2 or more years in length), the _seasonal cycle_ (1 year), the _primary_ or _intermediate cycle_ (9 to 26 weeks), and the _trading cycle_ (4 weeks). The trading cycle breaks down into two shorter _alpha_ and _beta_ cycles, which average 2 weeks each. (The labels Primary, Trading, Alpha, and Beta are used by Walt Bressert to describe the various cycle lengths.)

> There are even longer range cycles at work. Perhaps the best known is the approximate 54 year Kondratieff cycle. This controversial long cycle of economic activity, first discovered by a Russian economist in the 1920s by the name of Nikolai D. Kondratieff, appears to exert a major influence on virtually all stock and commodity prices. In particular, a 54 year cycle has been identified in interest rates, copper, cotton, wheat, stocks, and wholesale commodity prices. Kondratieff tracked his “long wave” from 1789 using such factors as commodity prices, pig iron production, and wages of agricultural workers in England. ...

> 
> As a general rule, long term and seasonal cycles determine the major trend of a market. Obviously, if a two year cycle has bottomed, it can be expected to advance for at least a year, measured from its trough to its crest. Therefore, the long term cycle exerts major influence on market direction. Markets also have annual seasonal patterns, meaning that they tend to peak or trough at certain times of the year. Grain markets, for example, usually hit their low point around harvest time and rally from there. Seasonal moves usually last for several months.
> 
> ...
> 
> Whether or not the moon has anything to do with it, the average 28 day cycle does exist and explains many of the numbers used in the development of shorter term indicators and trading systems. First of all, the 28 day cycle is based on calendar days. Translated into actual trading days, the number becomes 20. We’ve already commented on how many popular moving averages, oscillators, and weekly rules are based on the number 20 and its harmonically related shorter cycles, 10 and 5. The 5, 10, and 20 day moving averages are widely used along with their derivatives, 4, 9, and 18. Many traders use 10 and 40 day moving averages, with the number 40 being the next harmonically related longer cycle at twice the length of 20.
> 
> ...
> 
> In order to study the various cycles affecting any given market, it is necessary to first isolate each dominant cycle. There are various ways of accomplishing this task. The simplest is by visual inspection. By studying daily bar charts, for example, it is possible to identify obvious tops and bottoms in a market. By taking the average time periods between those cyclic tops and bottoms, certain average lengths can be found.
> 
> ...
> 
> All markets are affected to some extent by an annual seasonal cycle. The seasonal cycle refers to the tendency for markets to move in a given direction at certain times of the year. The most obvious seasonals involve the grain markets where seasonal lows usually occur around harvest time when supply is most plentiful. In soybeans, for example, most seasonal tops occur between April and June with seasonal bottoms taking place between August and October.

> Did you know that the strongest three month span for the stock market is November through January? February is then weaker, but is followed by a strong March and April. After a soft June, the market turns strong during July (the start of the traditional summer rally). The weakest month of the year is September. The strongest month is December (ending with the well known Santa Claus rally just after Christmas). That information, and a whole lot more about stock market cycles, can be found in Yale Hirsch’s annual _Stock Trader’s Almanac_ (The Hirsch Organization, 184 Central Avenue, Old Tappen, NJ 07675).
> 
> According to Hirsch: “as January goes, so goes the year.” The well known January Barometer holds that what the S&P 500 does during January will determine what kind of year the market as a whole will have. Another variation on that theme is the belief that the direction of the S&P 500 during the first 5 trading days of the year gives some hint of what’s ahead for the year. The January Barometer shouldn’t be confused with the January Effect, which is the tendency for smaller stocks to outperform larger stocks during January.
> 
> ...
> 
> Two of the most promising areas of overlap between cycles and traditional technical indicators are in the use of moving averages and oscillators. It is believed that the usefulness of both indicators can be enhanced if the time periods used are tied to each market’s dominant cycles. Let’s assume that a market has a dominant 20 day trading cycle. Normally, when constructing an oscillator, it’s best to use half the length of the cycle. In this case, the oscillator period would be 10 days. To trade a 40 day cycle, use a 20 day oscillator.
> 
> Moving averages can also be tied to cycles. You could use different moving averages to track different cycle lengths. To generate a moving average crossover system for a 40 day cycle, you could use a 40 day moving average in conjunction with a 20 day average (one-half of the 40 day cycle) or a 10 day average (one-quarter of the 40 day cycle). The main problem with this approach is determining what the dominant cycles are at a particular point in time.

### Chapter 15, Computers and Trading Systems

> It may strike you that there are too many indicators from which to choose. Instead of simplifying our lives, has the computer only served to complicate things by giving us so much more to look at? Charting packages offer 80 different studies that are available to the technician. How does one possibly reach any conclusions (and find the time to trade) with so much data to contend with? We’ll say a few words about some work being done in that direction.
> 
> ...
> 
> When first starting out, the user must collect historical data going back for at least several months to have something to work with. After that, data should be collected daily. It is possible to analyze “on line” data during the trading day by hooking up to a quote service. However, in our use of daily data, we will be referring to end-of-day data, which is available after the markets close. The final piece of equipment you might want is a printer to obtain a copy of whatever appears on the terminal screen. ...

Notice the large number of oscillators available. Pick one or two that you are most comfortable with and go with them. Use such things as cycles and Fibonacci tools as secondary inputs unless you have a special interest in those areas. Cycles can help fine tune moving average and oscillator lengths, but require study and practice. ***For mechanical trading systems, Wilder’s Parabolic and DMI are especially noteworthy***.

> 1. Participation is virtually guaranteed in the direction of every important trend.

> Disadvantages of Mechanical Systems
> 
> 1. Most mechanical systems are trend-following.

> 1. Trend-following systems are generally nonprofitable when markets are not trending.
> 1. There are long periods of time when markets are not trending and, therefore, not suitable for a trending approach.
> 
> The major problem is the failure of the system to recognize when the market is not trending and its inability to turn itself off. The measure of a good system is not only its ability to make money in trending markets, but its ability to preserve capital during nontrending periods. It is this inability of the system to monitor itself that is its greatest weakness. This is where some overriding filtering device, such as Welles Wilder’s Directional Movement system or the ADX line could prove especially useful by allowing the trader to determine which markets are most suitable for a trending system.
> 
> Another drawback is that no allowance is generally made for anticipating market reversals. Trend-following systems ride with the trend until it turns. They don’t recognize when a market has reached a long term support or resistance level, when oscillator divergences are being given, or when an Elliott Wave fifth pattern is clearly visible. Most traders would get more defensive at that point, and begin taking some profits. The system, however, will stay with the position until well after the market has changed direction. Therefore, it’s up to the trader to determine how best to employ the system. That is to say, whether it should be followed blindly or whether it should be incorporated into a trading plan with other technical factors. That brings us to our next section on how a mechanical system can be used as just another technical input into the forecasting and trading process.
> 
> The system signals can be used simply as a mechanical confirmation along with other technical factors. Even if the system is not being traded mechanically, and other technical factors are being employed, the signals could be used as a disciplined way to keep the trader on the right side of the major trend. No short positions would be taken as long as the computer trend was up. No longs would be taken in a computer downtrend. (This would be a simple way for fundamentally oriented traders to use a technical device as a filter or trigger on their own trading ideas.) Trend direction can be a matter of judgment. The computer signals relieve the trader of some degree of uncertainty. They can prevent him or her from falling into the trap of “top and bottom picking.”
> 
> System signals can also be used as an excellent screening device to alert the trader to recent trend changes. The trader can simply glance at the trend signals and instantly has several trading candidates. The same information could be found by studying all of the charts. The computer just makes that task quicker, easier, and more authoritative. The ability of the computer to automate system signals and then alert the trader when signals are triggered is an enormous asset, especially when the universe of financial markets has grown so large.

### Chapter 16. Money Management and Trading Tactics

> Any successful trading program must take into account three important factors: price forecasting, timing, and money management.
> 
> 1. _Price forecasting_ indicates which way a market is expected to trend. It is the crucial first step in the trading decision. The forecasting process determines whether the trader is bullish or bearish. It provides the answer to the basic question of whether to enter the market from the long or short side. If the price forecast is wrong, nothing else that follows will work.
> 
> 1. _Trading tactics_, or timing, determines specific entry and exit points. Timing is especially crucial in futures trading. Because of the low margin requirements and the resulting high leverage, there isn’t much room for error. It’s quite possible to be correct on the direction of the market, but still lose money on a trade if the timing is off. Timing is almost entirely technical in nature. Therefore, even if the trader is fundamentally oriented, technical tools must be employed at this point to determine specific entry and exit points.
> 
> 1. _Money management_ covers the allocation of funds. It includes such areas as portfolio makeup, diversification, how much money to invest or risk in any one market, the use of stops, reward-to-risk ratios, what to do after periods of success or adversity, and whether to trade conservatively or aggressively.
> 
> The simplest way to summarize the three different elements is that price forecasting tells the trader _what_ to do (buy or sell), timing helps decide _when_ to do it, and money management determines _how much_ to commit to the trade. The subject of price forecasting has been covered in the previous chapters. We’ll deal with the other two aspects here. We’ll discuss money management first because that subject should be taken into consideration when deciding on the appropriate trading tactics.
> 
> After having spent many years in the research department of a major brokerage firm, I made the inevitable switch to managing money. I quickly discovered the major difference between recommending trading strategies to others and implementing them myself. What surprised me was that the most difficult part of the transition had little to do with market strategies. The way I went about analyzing the markets and determining entry and exit points didn’t change much. What did change was my perception of the importance of money management. I was amazed at the impact such things as the size of the account, the portfolio mix, and the amount of money committed to each trade could have on the final results.
> 
> Needless to say, I am a believer in the importance of money management. The industry is full of advisors and advisory services telling clients _what_ to buy or sell and _when_ to do it. Very little is said about _how much_ of one’s capital to commit to each trade.
> 
> ...
> 
> While diversification is one way to limit risk exposure, it can be overdone. If a trader has trading commitments in too many markets at the same time, a few profitable trades may be diluted by a larger number of losing trades. A tradeoff exists and the proper balance must be found. Some successful traders concentrate their trading in a handful of markets. That’s fine as long as those markets are the ones that are trending at that time. The more negative correlation between the markets, the more diversification is achieved. Holding long positions in four foreign currency markets at the same time would not be a good example of diversification, since foreign currencies usually trend in the same direction against the U.S. dollar.
> 
> I strongly recommend the use of protective stops. Stop placement, however, is an art. The trader must combine technical factors on the price chart with money management considerations. We’ll show how this is done later in the chapter in the section on tactics. The trader must consider the volatility of the market. The more volatile the market is, the looser the stop that must be employed. Here again, a tradeoff exists. The trader wants the protective stop to be close enough so that losing trades are as small as possible. Protective stops placed too close, however, may result in unwanted liquidation on short term market swings (or “noise”). Protective stops placed too far away may avoid the noise factor, but will result in larger losses. The trick is to find the right middle ground.
> 
> The best futures traders make money on only 40% of their trades. That’s right. Most trades wind up being losers. How then do traders make money if they’re wrong most of the time? Because futures contracts require so little margin, even a slight move in the wrong direction results in forced liquidation. Therefore, it may be necessary for a trader to probe a market several times before catching the move he or she is looking for.
> 
> This brings us to the question of reward-to-risk ratios. Because most trades are losers, the only way to come out ahead is to ensure that the dollar amount of the winning trades is greater than that of the losing trades. To accomplish this, most traders use a reward-to-risk ratio. For each potential trade, a profit objective is determined. That profit objective (the reward) is then balanced against the potential loss if the trade goes wrong (the risk). A commonly used yardstick is a 3 to 1 reward-to-risk ratio. The profit potential must be at least three times the possible loss if a trade is to be considered.
> 
> “Letting profits run and cutting losses short” is one of the oldest maxims of trading. Large profits in trading are achieved by staying with persistent trends. Because only a relative handful of trades during the course of a year will generate large profits, it’s necessary to maximize those few big winners. Letting profits run is the way that is done. The other side of the coin is to keep losing trades as small as possible. You’d be surprised how many traders do just the opposite.
> 
> ...
> 
> The most effective way to use these technical concepts is to combine them. Remember that when we’re discussing timing, the basic decision to buy or sell has already been made. All we’re doing here is fine tuning the entry or exit point. If a buy signal has been given, the trader wants to get the best price possible. Suppose prices dip into the 40-60% buying zone, show a prominent support level in that zone, and/or have a potential support gap. Suppose further that a significant up trendline is nearby.
> 
> All of these factors used together would improve the timing of the trade. The idea is to buy near support, but to exit quickly if that support is broken. Violation of a tight down trendline drawn above the highs of a downside reaction could also be used as a buying signal. During a bounce in a downtrend, the breaking of a tight up trendline could be a shorting opportunity.
> 
> ...
> 
> Choosing the right type of trading order is a necessary ingredient in the tactical process. We’ll concern ourselves only with some of the more common types of orders: market, limit, stop, stop limit, and market-if-touched (M.I.T.).
> 
> 1. The _market order_ simply instructs your broker to buy or sell at the current market price. This is usually preferable in fast market conditions or when the trader wants to ensure that a position is taken and to protect against missing a potentially dynamic market move.
>
> 2. The _limit order_ specifies a price that the trader is willing to pay or accept. A buy limit order is placed below the current market price and states the highest price the trader is willing to pay for a purchase. A sell limit order is placed over the current market price and is the lowest price the seller is willing to accept. This type of resting order is used, for example, after a bullish breakout when the buyer wants to buy a downside reaction closer to support.
>
> 3. A _stop order_ can be used to establish a new position, limit a loss on an existing position, or protect a profit. A stop order specifies a price at which an order is to be executed. A buy stop is placed over the market and a sell stop under the market (which is the opposite of the limit order). Once the stop price is hit, the order becomes a market order and is executed at the best price possible. On a long position, a sell stop is placed below the market to limit a loss. After the market moves higher, the stop can be raised to protect the profit (a trailing stop). A buy stop could be placed above resistance to initiate a long position on a bullish breakout. Since the stop order becomes a market order, the actual “fill” price may be beyond the stop price, especially in a fast market.
> 
> 4. A _stop limit order_ combines both a stop and a limit order. This type of order specifies both a stop price where the trade is activated and a limit price. Once the stop is elected, the order becomes a limit order. This type of order is useful when the trader wants to buy or sell a breakout, but wants to control the price paid or received.
> 
> 5. The _market-if-touched (M.I.T.)_ order is similar to a limit order, except that it becomes a market order when the limit price is touched. An M.I.T. order to buy would be placed under the market like a limit order. When the limit price is hit, the trade is made at the market. This type of trade has one major advantage over the limit order. The buy limit order placed under the market does not guarantee a fill even if the limit price is touched. Prices may bounce sharply from the limit price, leaving the order unfilled. An M.I.T. order is most useful when the trader wants to buy the dip, but doesn’t want to risk missing the market after the limit price is hit.
> 
> ...
> 
> In order to achieve earlier entry with even tighter protective stops, some traders try to anticipate where a market will close by the use of pivot points. This technique combines seven key price levels with four time periods. The seven pivot points are the previous day’s high, low, and close and the current day’s open, high, low, and close. The four time periods are applied to the current trading day. They are the open, 30 minutes after the open, midday (about 12:30 New York time), and 35 minutes before the close.
> 
> These are average times and can be adjusted to the individual markets. The idea is to use pivot points only as a timing device when the trader believes a market is topping or bottoming. Buy or sell signals are given as the pivot points are broken during the day. The later in the day the signal is given, the stronger it is. As an illustration of a buy signal, if the market opens above the previous day’s close, but is below the previous day’s high, a buy stop is placed above the previous day’s high. If the buy stop is elected, a protective sell stop is placed below the current day’s low. At 35 minutes before the close, if no position has been taken, a buy stop is placed above the current day’s high, with a protective stop under today’s open. No action is generally taken during the first 30 minutes of trading. As the day progresses, the pivot points are narrowed as are the protective stops. As a final requirement on a buy signal, prices must close above both the previous day’s closing price and today’s opening price.

> 
> The trading tactics that we’ve covered in this chapter (and the analytical tools in preceding chapters) also apply to the stock market, with some minor adjustments. While futures traders focus on short to intermediate trends, stock investors are more concerned with intermediate to longer term trends. Stock trading places less emphasis on the very short term and makes less use of intraday charts. But the general principles remain the same for analyzing and trading markets—whether they’re in the futures pits of Chicago or on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
> 
> The money management guidelines presented in this chapter refer mainly to futures trading. However, many of the principles included in that discussion relate to the need for proper diversification in one’s investment portfolio and touches on the subject of asset allocation. Asset allocation refers to how a person’s portfolio is divided among stocks, bonds, and cash (usually in the form of a money market fund or Treasury Bills). It can also refer to how much of one’s portfolio should be allocated to foreign markets. Asset allocation also refers to how one’s stockholdings are spread among the various market sectors and industry groups. And, more recently, it deals with how much of one’s portfolio should be allocated to traditional commodity markets.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Proper diversification requires spreading one’s assets among market groups or classes that have a low correlation to each other—in other words, they don’t always trend in the same direction. Commodities certainly fit that criteria.

### Chapter 17. The Link Between Stocks and Futures: Intermarket Analysis

> On any given day, quotes are readily available for dollar futures, bond futures, and stock index futures—and they often move in sync with one another. The direction those three markets move is often affected by what happens in the commodity pits. _Program trading_, which occurs when the price of the S&P 500 futures contract is out of line with the S&P 500 cash index, is a day-to-day reality. For those reasons, it seems clear that the more understanding you have about the world of futures trading, the more insight you will gain into the entire financial marketplace.
> 
> ...
> 
> Each day, institutions calculate what the actual premium should be—called _fair value_. That fair value remains constant throughout the trading day, but changes gradually with each new day. When the futures premium moves above its fair value to the cash index by some predetermined amount, an arbitrage trade is automatically activated—called _program buying_. When the futures are too high relative to the cash index, program traders sell the futures contract and buy a basket of stocks in the S&P 500 to bring the two entities back into line. The result of program buying is positive for the stock market since it pushes the S&P 500 cash index higher. Program selling is just the opposite and occurs when the premium of the futures over the cash narrows too far below its fair value. In that case, _program selling_ is activated which results in the buying of S&P 500 futures and selling of the basket of stocks. Program selling is negative for the market. Most traders understand this relationship between the two related markets. What they don’t always understand is that the sudden moves in the S&P 500 futures contract, which activate the program trading, are often caused by sudden moves in other futures markets—like bonds.
> 
> The stock market is influenced by the direction of interest rates. The direction of interest rates (or yield) can be monitored on a minute-to-minute basis by tracking the movements in the Treasury Bond futures contract. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates or yields. Therefore, when bond prices are rising, yields are falling. That is normally considered positive for stocks.* Falling bond prices, or rising yields, are considered negative for stocks. From a technician’s point of view, it is very easy to compare the charts of Treasury Bond futures with the charts of either the S&P 500 cash index or its related futures contract. You’ll see that they have generally trended in the same direction.
> 
> ![Link Between Stocks and Futures: Rising bond prices](/.attachments/link.stocks.futures-rising.bond.prices.png)
> 
> _Rising bond prices are usually good for stock prices. The bond market bottoms in 1981, 1984, 1988, 1991, and 1995 led to major upturns in stocks. Bond peaks in 1987, 1990, and 1994 warned of bad stock market years._
> 
> Treasury Bond prices are influenced by expectations for inflation. Commodity prices are considered to be leading indicators of inflationary trends. As a result, commodity prices usually trend in the opposite direction of bond prices. If you study the market’s history since the 1970s, you’ll see that sudden upturns in commodity markets (signaling higher price inflation) have usually been associated with corresponding declines in Treasury Bond prices. The flip side of that relationship is that strong Treasury Bond gains have normally corresponded with falling commodity prices. Commodity prices, in turn, are impacted by the direction of the U.S. dollar.
> 
> ![Link Between Stocks and Futures: Commodity prices](/.attachments/link.stocks.futures-commodity.prices.png)
> 
> _Commodity prices and bond prices normally trend in opposite directions as shown here. The bond bottoms in the spring of 1996 and 1997 coincided with major peaks in commodity prices (see boxes)._
> 
> A rising U.S. dollar normally has a depressing effect on most commodity prices. In other words, a rising dollar is normally considered to be noninflationary. One of the commodities most effected by the dollar is the gold market. If you study their relationship over time, you’ll see that the prices of gold and the U.S. dollar usually trend in opposite directions. The gold market, in turn, usually acts as a leading indicator for other commodity markets. So, if you’re analyzing the gold market, it’s necessary to know what the dollar is doing. If you’re studying the commodity price trend in general (using one of the better known commodity price indexes), it’s necessary to know what the gold market is doing. The fact of the matter is that all four markets are linked—the dollar influences commodities, which influence bonds, which influence stocks. To fully comprehend what’s happening in any one asset class, it’s necessary to know what’s happening in the other three. Fortunately, that’s easily done by simply looking at their respective price charts.

> ![Link Between Stocks and Futures: Commodity prices](/.attachments/link.stocks.futures-gold.prices.png)
> 
> _The U.S. Dollar and gold prices usually trend in opposite directions as shown in this example. Gold prices, in turn, usually lead other commodities._
> 
> An understanding of these intermarket relationships also sheds light on the interaction between the various stock market sectors and industry groups. The stock market is divided into market sectors which are then subdivided into industry groups. These market categories are influenced by what’s happening on the intermarket scene. For example, when bonds are strong and commodities weak, interest rate-sensitive stock groups—such as the utilities, financial stocks, and consumer staples—usually do well relative to the rest of the stock market. At the same time, inflation-sensitive stock groups—like gold, energy, and cyclical stocks—usually underperform. When commodity markets are strong relative to bonds, the opposite is the case. By monitoring the relationship between Treasury Bond prices and commodity prices, you can determine which sectors or industry groups will do better at any given time.
> 
> ... Rising oil prices help energy shares but hurt airlines. Falling oil prices have the opposite effect.
> 
> Another intermarket relationship involves how the dollar affects large and small cap stocks. Large multinational stocks can be negatively impacted by a very strong dollar, which may make their products too expensive in foreign markets. By contrast, the more domestically oriented small cap stocks are less affected by dollar movements and may actually do better than larger stocks in a strong dollar environment. As a result, a stronger dollar may favor smaller stocks (like those in the Russell 2000), while a weaker dollar may benefit the large multinationals (like those in the Dow Industrial Average.)
> 
> It should be obvious that some understanding of these intermarket relationships can go a long way in mutual fund investing. The direction of the U.S. dollar, for example, might influence your commitment to small cap funds versus large cap funds. It may also help determine how much money you might want to commit to gold or natural resource funds. The availability of so many sector-oriented mutual funds actually complicates the decision of which ones to emphasize at any given time. That task is made a good deal easier by comparing the relative performance of the futures markets and the various stock market sectors and industry groups. That is easily accomplished by a simple charting approach called _relative strength_ analysis.
> 
> This is an extremely simple but effective charting tool. All you do is divide one market entity by another—in other words, plot a ratio of two market prices. When the ratio line is rising, the numerator price is stronger than the denominator. When the ratio line is declining, the denominator market is stronger. Consider some examples of what you can do with this simple indicator. Divide a commodity index (such as the CRB Futures Price Index) by Treasury Bond futures prices. When the ratio line is rising, commodity prices are outperforming bonds. In that scenario, futures traders would be buying commodity markets and selling bonds. At the same time, stock traders would be buying inflation sensitive stocks and selling interest-rate sensitive stocks. When the ratio line is falling, they would be doing the opposite. That is, they would sell commodities and buy bonds. At the same time, stock investors would be selling the golds, the oils, and the cyclicals, while buying the utilities, the financials, and consumer staples.

> Many exchanges now trade index options on various stock market sectors. The Chicago Board Options Exchange has the greatest selection and includes such diverse groups as automotive, computer software, environmental, gaming, real estate, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The American and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges offer popular index options on banks, gold, oil, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, technology, and utilities. All of these index options can be charted and analyzed like any other market. The best way to use relative strength analysis on them is to divide their price by some industry benchmark such as the S&P 500. You can then determine which are outperforming the overall market (a rising RS line) or underperforming (a falling RS line). Employing some simple charting tools like trendlines and moving averages on the relative strength lines themselves will help you spot important changes in their trend. The general idea is to rotate your funds into those sectors of the market whose relative strength lines are just turning up, and to rotate out of those market groups whose relative strength lines are just turning down. Those moves can be implemented either with the index options themselves or through mutual funds that match the various market sectors and industry groups.
> 
> ...
> 
> The intermarket principles described herein are based on market trends since 1970. The 1970s saw runaway inflation which favored commodity assets. The decades of the 1980s and 1990s have been characterized by falling commodities (disinflation) and strong bull markets in bonds and stocks. During the second half of 1997, a severe downturn in Asian currency and stock markets was especially damaging to markets like copper, gold, and oil. For the first time in decades, some market observers expressed concern that a beneficial disinflation (prices rising at a slower level) might turn into a harmful deflation (falling prices). To add to the concerns, producer prices fell on an annual basis for the first time in more than a decade. As a result, the bond and stock markets began to decouple. For the first time in four years, investors were switching out of stocks and putting more money into bonds and rate-sensitive stock groups like utilities. The reason for that asset allocation adjustment is that deflation changes the intermarket scenario. The inverse relationship between bond prices and commodities is maintained. Commodities fall while bond prices rise. The difference is that the stock market can react negatively in that environment. We point this out because it’s been a long time since the financial markets had to deal with the problem of price deflation. If and when deflation does occur, intermarket relationships will still be present but in a different way. Disinflation is bad for commodities, but good for bonds and stocks. Deflation is good for bonds and bad for commodities, but may also be bad for stocks.

Disinflation refers to a decrease in the rate of inflation, meaning that prices are still rising but at a slower pace compared to the previous period. It is important to note that disinflation is different from deflation. In deflation, prices actually decrease, leading to a general fall in the overall price level.

Disinflation can occur for various reasons, such as a decrease in demand for goods and services, improved productivity, or effective monetary policy measures. Central banks often aim for a moderate level of inflation to promote economic growth and avoid deflationary pressures.

> The deflationary trend that started in Asia in mid-1997 spread to Russia and Latin America by mid-1998 and began to hurt all global equity markets. A plunge in commodity prices had an especially damaging impact on commodity exporters like Australia, Canada, Mexico, and Russia. The deflationary impact of falling commodity and stock prices had a positive impact on Treasury bond prices, which hit record highs. Market events of 1998 were a dramatic example of the existence of global intermarket linkages and demonstrated how bonds and stocks can decouple in a deflationary world.
> 
> **INTERMARKET CORRELATION**
> 
> Two markets that normally trend in the same direction, such as bonds and stocks, are positively correlated. Markets that trend in opposite directions, like bonds and commodities, are negatively correlated. Charting software allows you to measure the degree of correlation between different markets. A high positive reading suggests a strong positive correlation. A high negative reading suggests a strong negative correlation. A reading near zero suggests little or no correlation between two markets. By measuring the degree of correlation, the trader is able to establish how much emphasis to place on a particular intermarket relationship. More weight should be placed on those with higher correlations, and less weight on those closer to zero.
> 
> In his book, _Cybernetic Trading Strategies_, Murray Ruggiero, Jr. presents creative work on the subject of intermarket correlations. He also shows how to use intermarket filters on trading systems. He demonstrates, for example, how a moving-average crossover system in the bond market can be used as a filter for stock index trading. Ruggiero explores the application of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods like chaos theory, fuzzy logic, and neural networks to the development of technical trading systems. He also explores the application of neural networks to the field of intermarket analysis.

### Chapter 18. Stock Market Indicators

> In the previous chapter, we described the top-down approach that is most commonly employed in stock market analysis. With that approach, you begin your analysis with a study of the health of the overall market. Then you work down to market sectors and industry groups. The final step is the study of individual stocks. Your goal is to pick the best stocks in the best groups in an environment when the stock market is technically healthy. The study of market sectors and individual stocks can be accomplished with the technical tools employed throughout this book—including chart patterns, volume analysis, trendlines, moving averages, oscillators, etc. Those same indicators can also be applied to the major market averages. But there’s another class of market indicators widely employed in stock market analysis whose purpose is to determine the health of the overall stock market by measuring market breadth. The data used in their construction are advancing versus declining issues, new highs versus new lows, and up volume versus down volume.
> 
> **SAMPLE DATA**
> 
> If you check the Stock Market Data Bank section of The Wall Street Journal (Section C, page 2) each day, you’ll find the following data for the previous trading day. The numbers shown are based on an actual day’s trading results.
> 
> | Diaries NYSE | Monday |
> |:--- | ---:|
> | Issues Traded | 3,432 |
> | Advances | 1,327 |
> | Declines | 1,559 |

> 
> The above figures are derived from New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) data. A similar breakdown is also shown for the NASDAQ and the American Stock Exchange. We’ll concentrate on the NYSE in this discussion. It just so happens that on that particular day the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 12.20 points. So the market was up as measured by the Dow. However, there were more declining stocks (1,559) than advancing stocks (1,327), suggesting that the broader market didn’t fare as well as the Dow. There was also more declining volume than advancing volume. Those two sets of figures suggest that market breadth was actually negative for that particular day—even though the Dow itself closed higher. The other figures present a more mixed picture. The number of stocks hitting new 52 week highs (78) was greater than those hitting new lows (43) suggesting a positive market environment. However, the closing tick (the number of stocks that closed on an uptick versus a downtick) was a negative, -135. That meant that 135 more stocks closed on a downtick than an uptick, a short term negative factor. The negative closing tick, however, is offset by a closing Arms (Trin) reading of .96 which is mildly positive. We’ll explain why that is later in the chapter. All of these internal market readings have one intended purpose—to give us a more accurate reading on the health of the overall market that isn’t always reflected in the movement of the Dow itself.
> 
> Another way to study the breadth of the market is to compare the performance of the stock averages [or indices percentage changes] themselves. ...
> 
> ...
> 
> Each day’s trading on the New York Stock Exchange produces a certain number of stocks that advanced, a number that declined, and a number that remained unchanged. These figures are reported each day in _The Wall Street Journal_ and _Investor’s Business Daily_, and are used to construct a daily advance-decline (AD) line. The most common way to calculate the AD line is to take the difference between the number of advancing issues and the number of declining issues. If there are more advances than declines, the AD number for that day is positive. If there are more declines than advances, the AD line for that day is negative. That positive or negative daily number is then added to the cumulative AD line. The AD line displays a trend of its own. The idea is to make sure the AD line and the market averages are trending in the same direction.

> 
> _The NYSE advance-decline line versus the Dow Industrials. In a healthy market, both lines should be trending upward together as they are here._
> 
> What does the advance-decline line measure? The advance-decline line tells us whether or not the broader universe of 3500 NYSE stocks is advancing in line with the most widely followed stock averages, which include only the 30 Dow Industrials or the 500 stocks in the S&P 500. To paraphrase a Wall Street maxim: the advance-decline line tells us if the “troops” are keeping up with the “generals.” As long as the AD line is advancing with the Dow Industrials, for example, the breadth or health of the market is good. The danger appears when the AD line begins to diverge from the Dow. In other words, when you have a situation where the Dow Industrials are hitting new highs while the broader market (measured by the AD line) isn’t following, technicians begin to worry about “bad market breadth” or an AD divergence. Historically, the AD line peaks out well ahead of the market averages, which is why it’s watched so closely.
> 
> The daily AD line, which we have described herein, is better used for short to intermediate comparisons with the major stock averages. It is less useful for comparisons going back several years. A weekly advance-decline line measures the number of advancing versus declining stocks for the entire week. Those figures are published in _Barron’s_ each weekend. A weekly advance-decline line is considered more useful for trend comparisons spanning several years. While a negative divergence in the daily AD line may warn of short to intermediate problems in the market, it’s necessary to also show a similar divergence in the weekly AD line to confirm that a more serious problem is developing.
> 
> Since the number of stocks traded on the NYSE has grown over the years, some market analysts believe the method of subtracting the number of declining issues from the number of advancing issues gives greater weight to the more recent data. To combat that problem, many technicians prefer to use an advance/decline ratio which divides the number of advancing issues by the number of declining issues. Some also believe that there’s value in including the number of unchanged issues in the calculation. Whichever way the AD line is calculated, its use is always the same—that is, to measure the direction of the broader market and to ensure it’s moving in the same direction as the more narrowly constructed, but popular market averages. Advance decline lines can also be constructed for the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Market. Market technicians like to construct overbought/oversold oscillators on the AD lines to help measure short to intermediate term market extremes in the breadth figures themselves. One of the better known examples is the McClellan Oscillator.
> 
> Developed by Sherman McClellan, this oscillator is constructed by taking the difference between two exponential moving averages of the daily NYSE advance-decline figures. The McClellan Oscillator is the difference between the 19 day (10% trend) and the 39 day (5% trend) exponential moving averages of the daily net advance decline figures. The oscillator fluctuates around a zero line with its upper and lower extremes ranging from +100 and -100. ***A McClellan Oscillator reading above +100 is a signal of an overbought stock market.*** A reading below -100 is considered an oversold stock market. Crossings above and below the zero line are also interpreted as short to intermediate term buying and selling signals respectively.

> 
> The Summation Index is simply a longer range version of the McClellan Oscillator. The McClellan Summation Index is a cumulative sum of each day’s positive or negative readings in the McClellan Oscillator. Whereas the McClellan Oscillator is used for short to intermediate trading purposes, the Summation Index provides a longer range view of market breadth and is used to spot major market turning points.

> 
> ... When the number of new highs start to decline, or the number of new lows start to expand, a caution signal is given. A negative market signal is activated when the moving average of new lows crosses above the moving average of new highs. It can also be shown that whenever the new highs reach an extreme, the market has a topping tendency. Similarly, whenever new lows reach an extreme, the market is near a bottom. Another way to use the new highs versus new lows numbers is to plot the difference between the two lines.

> The trend of the high-low line can be charted and it can be used to spot market divergences. A new high in the Dow, for example, that is not matched by a corresponding new high in the high-low line could be a sign of weakness in the broader market. Trendline and moving-average analysis can be applied to the line itself. But its major value is in either confirming or diverging from the major stock trends and giving early warning of potential trend changes in the overall market. Dr. Alexander Elder describes the New High-New Low index as “probably the best leading indicator of the stock market” _Trading for a Living_, (Wiley).
> 
> Elder suggests plotting the indicator as a histogram with a horizontal reference point at its zero line, making divergences easier to spot. He points out that crossings above and below the zero line also reflect bullish and bearish shifts in market psychology.

> This is the third and final piece of data that is utilized to measure the breadth of the market. The New York Stock Exchange also provides the level of volume in both the advancing and declining issues. That data is also available the next day in the financial press.

> The upside volume and downside volume can be shown as two separate lines (just as we did with the new highs and new lows figures) or the difference can be shown as a single line. Either way, the interpretation is always the same. When the upside volume is dominant, the market is strong. When downside volume is greater, the market is weak. It’s possible to combine the number of advancing and declining issues with advancing and declining volume. That’s what Richard Arms did in the creation of the Arms Index.
> 
> The Arms Index, named after its creator Richard Arms, is a ratio of a ratio. The numerator is the ratio of the number of advancing issues divided by the number of declining issues. The denominator is the advancing volume divided by declining volume. The purpose of the Arms Index is to gauge whether there’s more volume in rising or falling stocks. A reading below 1.0 indicates more volume in rising stocks and is positive. A reading above 1.0 reflects more volume in declining issues and is negative. On an intraday basis, a very high Arms Index reading is positive, while a very low reading is negative. The Arms Index, therefore, is a contrary indicator that trends in the opposite direction of the market. It can be used for intraday trading by tracking its direction and for spotting signs of short term market extremes.
> 
> The Arms Index (TRIN) can be used in conjunction with the TICK indicator for intraday trading. TICK measures the difference between the number of stocks trading on an uptick versus the number trading on a downtick. The TICK is a minute-by-minute version of the daily advance-decline line and is used for the same purpose. When combining the two during the day, a rising TICK indicator and a falling Arms Index (TRIN) are positive, while a falling TICK indicator and a rising Arms Index (TRIN) are negative. The Arms Index, however, can also be used for longer range analysis.
> 
> ![Stock Market Indicators: Arms Index](/.attachments/stock.market.indicators-arms.index.png)
> 
> _The Arms Index (also called TRIN) trends in the opposite direction of the market. Exceptionally high spikes usually signal market bottoms. A 10-day moving average of the Arms Index is a popular way to view this contrary indicator._
> 
> While the Arms Index is quoted throughout the trading day and has some short term forecasting value, most traders use a 10 day moving average of its values. According to Arms himself, a 10 day average of the Arms Index above 1.20 is considered oversold, while a 10 day Arms value below .70 is overbought, although those numbers may shift depending on the overall trend of the market. Arms expresses a preference for Fibonacci numbers as well. He suggests using a 21 day Arms Index in addition to the 10 day version. He also utilizes 21 day and 55 day moving-average crossovers of the Arms Index to generate good intermediate term trades. ...
> 
> In calculating the 10 day Arms Index, each day’s closing value is determined using the four inputs and that final value is smoothed with a 10 day moving average. In the “Open” version of the Arms Index, each of the four components in the formula is averaged separately over a period of 10 days. The Open Arms Index is then calculated from those four different averages. Many analysts prefer the Open Arms version to the original version. Different moving average lengths, like 21 and 55 days, can also be applied to the Open Arms version.

> ... Since technical analysts combine price and volume analysis, they have to look at both parts of the chart at the same time. On the Equivolume chart, each price bar is shown as a rectangle. The height of the rectangle measures the day’s trading range. The width of the rectangle is determined by that day’s volume. Heavier volume days produce a wider rectangle. Lighter volume days are reflected in a narrower rectangle.

In an uptrend, for example, up days should see wider rectangles while down days should see narrower rectangles. Equivolume charting can be applied to market averages as well as individual stocks and can be plotted for both daily and weekly charts.

> Most important divergences involve the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000. The Nasdaq Composite has the largest number of stocks (5000). However, since the Nasdaq is a capitalization-weighted index, it is usually dominated by the one hundred largest technology stocks like Intel and Microsoft. Because of that, the Nasdaq is more often a measure of the direction of the technology sector. The Russell 2000 is a truer measure of the smaller stock universe. Both indexes, however, should be trending upward along with the Dow and the S&P 500 if the trend of the market is truly healthy.
> 
> Relative strength (RS) analysis plays a useful role here. A ratio of the Nasdaq to the S&P 500 tells us whether the technology stocks are leading or lagging. It’s usually better for the market if they’re leading and the ratio line is rising.

### Chapter 19. Putting It All Together - A Checklist

> ... technical analysis is a blend of many approaches. Each approach adds something to the analyst’s knowledge of the market. Technical analysis is much like putting together a giant jigsaw puzzle. Each technical tool holds a piece of the puzzle. My approach to market analysis is to combine as many techniques as possible. Each works better in certain market situations. The key is knowing which tools to emphasize in the current situation. That comes with knowledge and experience.
> 
> All of these approaches overlap to some extent and complement one another. The day the user sees these interrelationships, and is able to view technical analysis as the sum of its parts, is the day that person deserves the title of technical analyst. The following checklist is provided to help the user touch all the bases, at least in the early going. Later on, the checklist becomes second nature. The checklist is not all-inclusive, but does have most of the more important factors to keep in mind. Sound market analysis seldom consists of doing the obvious. The technician is constantly seeking clues to future market movement. ***The final clue that leans the trader in one direction or the other is often some minor factor that has gone largely unnoticed by others. The more factors the analyst considers, the better the chances of finding that right clue.***
> 
> **TECHNICAL CHECKLIST**
> 
> 1. What is the direction of the overall market?
> 1. What is the direction of the various market sectors?
> 1. What are the _weekly_ and _monthly_ charts showing?
> 1. Are the major, intermediate, and minor _trends_ up, down, or sideways?
> 1. Where are the important _support_ and _resistance_ levels?
> 1. Where are the important _trendlines_ or _channels_?
> 1. Are _volume_ and _open interest_ confirming the price action?
> 1. Where are the 33%, 50%, and 66% _retracements_?
> 1. Are there any price gaps and what type are they?
> 1. Are there any _major reversal patterns_ visible?
> 1. Are there any _continuation patterns_ visible?
> 1. What are the _price objectives_ from those patterns?

> 1. Which way is the _computer trend_ moving: up, down, or sideways?
> 1. What are the _point and figure_ charts or _candlesticks_ showing?
>
> After you’ve arrived at a bullish or bearish conclusion, ask yourself the following questions.
> 
> 1. Which way will this market trend over the next several months?
> 1. Am I going to buy or sell this market?
> 1. How many units will I trade?
> 1. How much am I prepared to risk if I’m wrong?
> 1. What is my profit objective?
> 1. Where will I enter the market?
> 1. What type of order will I use?
> 1. Where will I place my protective stop?
> 
> Going through the checklist won’t guarantee the right conclusions. It’s only meant to help you ask the right questions. Asking the right questions is the surest way of finding the right answers. The keys to successful trading are knowledge, discipline, and patience. Assuming that you have the knowledge, the best way to achieve discipline and patience is doing your homework and having a plan of action. The final step is putting that plan of action to work. Even that won’t guarantee success, but it will greatly increase the odds of winning in the financial markets.

> **HOW TO COORDINATE TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS**
> 
> Despite the fact that technicians and fundamentalists are often at odds with one another, there are ways they can work together for mutual benefit. Market analysis can be approached from either direction. While I believe that technical factors do lead the known fundamentals, I also believe that any important market move must be caused by underlying fundamental factors. Therefore, it simply makes sense for a technician to have some awareness of the fundamental condition of a market. If nothing else, the technician can inquire from his or her fundamental counterpart as to what would have to happen fundamentally to justify a significant market move identified on a price chart. In addition, seeing how the market reacts to fundamental news can be used as an excellent technical indication.
> 
> The fundamental analyst can use technical factors to confirm an analysis or as an alert that something important may be happening. The fundamentalist can consult a price chart or use a computer trend-following system as a filter to prevent him or her from assuming a position opposite an existing trend. Some unusual action on a price chart can act as an alert for the fundamental analyst and cause him or her to examine the fundamental situation a bit closer. During my years in the technical analysis department of a major brokerage firm, ***I often approached our fundamental department to discuss some market move that seemed imminent on the price charts. I often received responses like “that can never happen” or “no way.” Very often, that same person was scrambling a couple of weeks later to find fundamental reasons to explain a sudden and “unexpected” market move. There’s obviously room for much more coordination and cooperation in this area.***
> 
> ...
> 
> **TECHNICAL ANALYSIS BY ANY NAME**
> 
> After a century of use in this country (and 300 years in Japan), technical analysis is more popular than ever. Of course, it’s not always called technical analysis. In my book, _The Visual Investor_, I called it _visual analysis_. That was simply an attempt to get people beyond the intimidating title of technical analysis and to get them to examine this valuable approach more closely. Whatever you want to call it, technical analysis is practiced under many names. ***A lot of financial organizations employ analysts whose job it is to number-crunch market prices to find stocks or stock groups that are expensive (overbought) or cheap (oversold). They’re called quantitative analysts, but the numbers they crunch are often the same ones the technicians are crunching.*** The financial press has written about a “new” class of trader called “momentum” players. These traders move funds out of stocks and stock groups that are showing poor momentum and into those that are showing good momentum. They use a technique called relative strength. Of course, we recognize “momentum” and “relative strength” as technical terms.
> 
> Then there are the brokerage firms’ “fundamental” upgrades and downgrades. Have you noticed how often these “fundamental” changes take place the day after a significant “chart” breakout or breakdown? Economists, who certainly don’t consider themselves technical analysts, use charts all the time to measure the direction of inflation, interest rates, and all sorts of economic indicators. And they talk about the “trend” of those charts. Even fundamental tools like the price/earnings ratio have a technical side to them. ***Anytime you introduce price into the equation, you’re moving into the realm of technical analysis.*** Or when security analysts say the dividend yield of the stock market is too low, aren’t they saying prices are too high? Isn’t that the same thing as saying a market is overbought?
> 
> Finally, there are the academics who have reinvented technical analysis under the new name of _Behavioral Finance_. For years, the academics espoused the Efficient Market Hypothesis to prove that technical analysis simply didn’t work. No less an authority than the Federal Reserve Board has thrown some doubt on those ideas.


## Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques

© 2001 by Steve Nison

### Chapter 1. Introduction

> Year after year the flames of interest grow ever brighter for these charting tools. This is because candle charts:
> 
> - _Are easy to understand_: Anyone, from the first-time chartist to the seasoned professional, can easily harness the power of candle charts. Don’t let the simplicity of these tools fool you. Their power to analyze the health of the market is unmatched by any other charting methodology.
>
> - _Provide earlier indications of market turns_: Candle charts often send out reversal signals well before those of traditional indicators on bar or point and figure charts. This should help you to enter and exit the market with better timing.
>
> - _Furnish unique market insights_: Candle charts not only show the trend of the move, as does a bar chart, but, unlike bar charts, candle charts also show the force underpinning the move.
> 
> - _Are enjoyable to learn_: The picturesque terms such as _dark-cloud covers_, _hammers_, and _windows_ make candle charts fun to use. But don’t let the “picturesque” names fool you. These techniques will be potent weapons in your battle with the markets.
> 
> - _Enhance Western charting analysis_: Candle charts are so versatile, they can be fused with any Western technical tool. For our clients, we merge the insights given by the candle charts with the most potent Western technical analysis tools. If you are a seasoned technician, you will discover how joining Japanese candles with your favorite technical tools can create a powerful synergy of techniques. This merging of Eastern and Western analysis will give you a jump on those who use only traditional Western charting techniques.
> 
> - _Will increase efficiency of your analysis_: Because of the immediate visual information sent out by the candle charts, they will make your market analysis faster and more efficient.
> 
> ...
> 
> Candle charts provide many useful trading signals. They do not, however, provide price targets. This is why it is so important to use Western technical techniques on candle charts.
> 
> ...
> 
> Candles are not designed to be a complete system; they are just one weapon, albeit a powerful one, to use in your trading battles.
> 
> ...
> 
> The importance of technical analysis is multifaceted. First, while fundamental analysis may provide a gauge of the supply/demand situations (i.e., price/earnings ratios, economic statistics) and so forth, there is no psychological component involved in such analysis. Yet the markets are influenced at times, to a major extent, by emotionalism. As John Maynard Keynes stated, “There is nothing so disastrous as a rational investment policy in an irrational world.”? Technical analysis provides the only mechanism to measure the “irrational” (emotional) component present in all markets.
> 
> ...
> 
> Discipline helps mitigate the nemesis of all traders, namely, emotion. As soon as you have money in the market, emotionalism is in the driver’s seat and rationale and objectivity are merely passengers. If you doubt this, try paper trading. Then try trading with your own funds. You will soon discover how deeply the counterproductive aspects of tension, anticipation, and anxiety alter the way you trade and view the markets—usually in proportion to the funds committed. Technicals can put objectivity back into the driver’s seat. They provide a mechanism to set entry and exit points, to set risk/reward ratios, or stop out levels. By using them, you foster a risk and money management approach to trading.
> 
> ...
> 
> Fourth, random walk proffers that the market price for one day has no bearing on the price the following day. But this academic view leaves out an important component—people. People remember prices from one day to the next and act accordingly. To wit, people’s reactions indeed affect price, but price also affects people’s reactions. Thus, price, itself, is an important component in market analysis. Those who disparage technical analysis forget this last point.
> 
> Fifth, the price action is the most direct and easily accessible method of seeing overall supply/demand relationships. There may be fundamental news not known to the general public, but you can expect it is already in the price. Those who have advance knowledge of some market-moving event will most likely buy or sell until current prices reflect their information.

### Chapter 3. Constructing the Candlestick Lines

> ![Bar Chart vs. Candle Chart](/.attachments/bar.chart.vs.candle.chart.png)
> 
> The rectangular sections of the candle lines are called the real body. The real body represents the range between the session’s open and close. When the real body is black (i.e., filled), it means the close of the session was lower than the open. If the real body is white (i.e., empty), it shows the close was higher than the open.
> 
> The thin lines above and below the real body are the shadows (these names are almost lyrical—the real body and the shadows of these real bodies.) These shadows represent the session’s price extremes. The shadow above the real body is called the upper shadow and the shadow below the real body is the lower shadow. Accordingly, the peak of the upper shadow is the high of the session and the bottom of the lower shadow is the low of the session.
> 
> ...
> 
> The Japanese say the real body is “the essence of the price movement.” This reflects a central concept about the power of the real bodies: By looking at the height and color of the real body, we get an immediate visual clue whether it’s the bulls or bears who are in control.

In trading, a candlestick represents the price movement of an asset within a specific timeframe, commonly used in technical analysis. The high and low points of a candlestick provide crucial information:

1. **High:** The topmost point of the vertical line (wick) represents the highest price reached for that asset within the chosen timeframe (e.g., a day, an hour, etc.). It signifies the highest price buyers were willing to pay during that period.

2. **Low:** The bottom of the vertical line (wick) indicates the lowest price reached for the asset within the same timeframe. It reflects the lowest price at which sellers were willing to sell during that period.

The open and close on a candlestick represent the prices at which an asset began and ended within a specific timeframe, such as a day, hour, or minute.

- **Open:** The open price is depicted by the start of the candlestick's body. It signifies the price at which the asset started trading at the beginning of the selected timeframe.

- **Close:** The close price is represented by the end of the candlestick's body. It shows the price at which the asset concluded trading at the end of the selected timeframe.

The color of the candlestick (often green or red) depends on whether the closing price was higher or lower than the opening price:

- **Green/White Candle:** The closing price is higher than the opening price, indicating a net price increase during that timeframe.
  
- **Red/Black Candle:** The closing price is lower than the opening price, signifying a net price decrease during that timeframe.

The body of the candlestick illustrates the price range between the open and close. If the close is higher than the open, the body is typically hollow or filled in, representing an uptrend. Conversely, if the close is lower than the open, the body is usually filled or colored, indicating a downtrend.

Understanding the open and close prices assists traders in gauging market sentiment, price direction, and potential trend reversals.

### Chapter 4. Reversal Patterns

![Candlestick Cheet Sheet](/.attachments/candlestick.cheat.sheet.webp)

> Technicians watch for price clues alerting them to a shift in market psychology and trend. Reversal patterns are these technical clues. Western reversal indicators include double tops and bottoms, reversal days, head and shoulders, and island tops and bottoms. Yet the term “reversal pattern” is somewhat of a misnomer. Hearing that term may lead you to think of an old trend ending abruptly and then reversing to a new trend. This rarely happens. Trend changes usually occur slowly, in stages, as the underlying psychology shifts gears. A trend reversal signal implies that the prior trend is likely to change, but not necessarily reversing. Compare a trend to a car traveling forward. The car’s red brake lights go on and the car stops. The brake light was the reversal indicator showing that the prior trend (that is, the car moving forward) was about to end. But now that the car is stationary, will the driver then decide to put the car in reverse? Will he or she remain stopped? Will he or she decide to go forward again?
> 
> ... 

#### UMBRELLA LINES
 
> Umbrella lines are candles with very long lower shadows and a small real body at the top end of the range. These umbrella lines are fascinating in that these lines can be either bullish or bearish according to the market environment.
> 
> If an umbrella line emerges during a downtrend, it is a signal that the downtrend should end. In such a scenario, this umbrella line is labeled a _hammer_, as in “the market is hammering out” a base. The actual Japanese word for the hammer is takuri. This word means “trying to gauge the depth of the water by feeling for its bottom.” This is a perfect analogy for the hammer line as the market attempts to grope for a bottom. Coincidently, the hammer line looks likes a hammer with its head and handle.
> 
> As mentioned above, the character of umbrella lines changes based on the prevailing trend before the umbrella line. We saw that an umbrella line after a decline is a bullish signal called a hammer. However, if either of the "umbrella" emerges after a rally, it is a potential top reversal signal ominously called _a hanging man_. The name “hanging man” is derived from the fact that it looks like a hanging man with dangling legs.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Wal-Mart Stores - Daily (Hammer)](/.attachments/wal-mart.stores.daily-hammer.png)
> 
> ...
> 
> The hanging man has the same shape as the hammer; the only difference is that a hanging man comes after an advance.
> 
> ![Microsoft - Daily (Hanging Man and Hammer)](/.attachments/microsoft-daily.hang.man.png)

#### THE ENGULFING PATTERN

> ... Most candle signals, ..., are based on combinations of individual candle lines. The engulfing pattern is the first of these multiple candle line patterns. The engulfing pattern is a major reversal signal with two opposite color real bodies composing this pattern.
> 
> ![Bullish Engulfing Pattern](/.attachments/bullish.engulfing.pattern.png)
> 
> _Bullish Engulfing Pattern_
> 
> When a white bullish real body wraps around, or _engulfs_, the prior period's black real body, it is indication of a _bullish engulfing pattern_. Another nickname is a "hugging line" for obvious reasons. This shows buying pressure has overwhelmed selling pressure.
> 
> ![Bearish Engulfing Patter](/.attachments/bearish.engulfing.pattern.png)
> 
> _Bearish Engulfing Pattern_
> 
> When a black real body wraps around, or _engulfs_, the prior period's white real body, it is indication of a _bearish engulfing pattern_. It is the signal of a top reversal. This shows that supply has overwhelmed demand.
> 
> There are three criteria for an engulfing pattern:
>
> 1. The market has to be in a clearly definable uptrend (for a bearish engulfing pattern) or downtrend (for a bullish engulfing pattern), even if the trend is short term.
> 
> 2. Two candles comprise the engulfing pattern. The second real body must engulf the prior real body (it need not engulf the shadows).
> 
> 3. The second real body of the engulfing pattern should be the opposite color of the first real body. (The exception to this rule is if the first real body of the engulfing pattern is a doji. Thus, after an extended fall, a doji engulfed by a very large white real body could be a bottom reversal. In an uptrend, a doji enveloped by a very large black real body could be a bearish reversal pattern).
> 
> ...
> 
> Some factors increasing the likelihood that an engulfing pattern could be an important turning signal are:
> 
> 1. If the first day of the engulfing pattern has a very small real body (i.e., a spinning top) and the second day has a very long real body. The small first real body candle reflects a dissipation of the prior trend’s force and the large second real body proves an increase in force behind the new move.
> 
> 2. If the engulfing pattern appears after a protracted or very fast move. A fast or extended move creates an overextended market (either overbought or oversold) and makes it vulnerable to profit taking.
> 
> 3. If there is heavy volume on the second real body of the engulfing pattern.

#### DARK-CLOUD COVER

> ![Dark Cloud Cover](/.attachments/dark.cloud.cover.png)
> 
> _Dark-Cloud Cover_
> 
> Our next reversal pattern is the _dark-cloud cover_. It is a dual-candle pattern that is a top reversal after an uptrend or, at times, at the top of a congestion band. The first day of this two-candle patter is a strong white real body. The second day's price opens above the prior's session's high (that is, above the top of the upper shadow). However, by the end of the second day's session, the market closes deeply within the prior day's white body. The greater degree of penetration into the white body, the more likely this is a top. Some Japanese technicians require more than a 50-percent penetration of the black session's close into the white real body. If the black candle does not close below the halfway point of the white candlestick, it may be best to wait for more bearish confirmation following the dark-cloud cover. In some circumstances it can be viewed as a dark-cloud cover even if the open is over the prior session's close instead of the prior session's high.
> 
> ...
> 
> Some factors intensifying the importance of dark-cloud covers include:
>
> 1. The greater the penetration of the black real body’s close into the prior white real body, the greater the chance for a top. (If the black real body covers the prior day’s entire white body, it would be a bearish engulfing pattern rather than a dark-cloud cover.) Think of the dark-cloud cover as a partial solar eclipse blocking out part of the sun (that is, covers only part of the prior white body). The bearish engulfing pattern can be viewed as a total solar eclipse blocking out the entire sun (that is, covers the entire white body). A bearish engulfing pattern, consequently, can be a more meaningful top reversal. If a long white real body closes above the highs of the dark-cloud cover, or the bearish engulfing pattern it could presage another rally.

> 2. During a prolonged ascent, if there is a strong white day that opens on its low (that is, a shaven bottom) and closes on its high (that is, a shaven head) and the next day reveals a long black real body day, opening on its high and closing on its low, then a shaven head and shaven bottom black day has occurred.
> 
> 3. If the second body (that is, the black body) of the dark-cloud cover opens above a major resistance level and then fails, it would prove the bulls were unable to take control of the market.
> 
> 4. If, on the opening of the second day, there is very heavy volume, then a buying blow off could have occurred. For example, heavy volume at a new opening high could mean that many new buyers have decided to jump aboard ship. Then the market sells off. It probably won't be too long before this multitude of new longs (and old longs who have ridden the uptrend) realize that the ship they jumped onto is the _Titanic_. For futures traders, very high opening interest can be another warning.

> In chart above we see a rally that began mid August. On August 22 the stock gapped higher and formed a hanging man session, but its potential bearish implications were not confirmed the next session since the next day’s close was over the hanging man’s real body. The stock had a final push with a gap higher opening on August 28 at $43.25. On that opening it looked fine from the bulls’ perspective. It closed down at $40.62 by the end of that session. This completed a dark-cloud cover since the black candle pulled well into the prior session’s white real body.
> 
> While this was a well-defined dark-cloud cover, from a risk—-reward perspective it may not have been a good place to sell. This is because the dark-cloud cover was finalized on the close of the second day of the pattern, and by then it was well off its highs. Using the concept of the dark-cloud cover as potential resistance, one could wait for a bounce to near the dark-cloud cover to sell (assuming this occurs). In early October a rally to the high of the dark-cloud cover showed signs of running out of steam with a small black real body and the same highs for four consecutive sessions at $43.25. The decline from early October ended with a hammer that confirmed a late September support area.

The rally from the second bullish engulfing pattern hesitated at the dark-cloud cover. Immediately after this pattern, a white real body marginally penetrated the dark-cloud cover’s resistance (shown at the horizontal line). While not a decisive breakout, it was a close above resistance and as such a positive signal.

#### PIERCING PATTERN

> As is true with most candle patterns, for each bearish pattern there is an opposite bullish pattern. So it is with the bearish dark-cloud cover. The dark-cloud cover’s counterpart is the bullish piercing pattern.
> 
> ![Piercing Pattern](/.attachments/piercing.pattern-support.png)
> 
> _Piercing Pattern_
> 
> The piercing pattern is composed of two candles in a falling market. The first candle is a black real body day and the second is a white real body. This white candle opens lower, ideally under the low of the prior black day. Then prices rebound to push well into the black candle’s real body.
> 
> The piercing pattern is akin to the bullish engulfing pattern. In the bullish engulfing pattern, the white real body engulfs the entire previous black real body. For the piercing pattern, the white real body pierces, but does not wrap around, the prior black body. In the piercing pattern, the greater the degree of penetration into the black real body, the more likely it will become a bottom reversal. An ideal piercing pattern will have a white real body that pushes more than halfway into the prior session’s black real body. The psychology behind the piercing pattern is as follows: The market is in a downtrend. The bearish black real body reinforces this view. The next session the market opens lower via a gap. The bears are watching the market with contentment. Then the market surges toward the close, managing not only to close unchanged from the prior day's close, but sharply above that close. The bears will be second-guessing their position. Those who are looking to buy would say new lows could not hold and could view it as an opportunity to buy.
> 
> The piercing pattern signal increases in importance based on the same factors 1 through 4 as with the dark-cloud cover, but in reverse. (See previous section.) With the dark-cloud cover we would like to see the black real body closing more than midway in the prior white candlestick. But there is some flexibility to this rule. There is less flexibility with the piercing pattern. The piercing pattern’s white candlestick should push more than halfway into the black candlestick’s real body. The reason for less latitude with the bullish piercing pattern than with the bearish dark-cloud cover pattern is the fact that the Japanese have three other patterns called the _on-neck_, _the in-neck_, and the _thrusting_ pattern.

> 
> They have the same basic formation as the piercing pattern. The difference among them is in the degree of penetration by the white candle into the black candle’s real body. The on-neck pattern’s white candle (usually a small one) closes near the low of the previous session. The in-neck pattern’s white candle closes slightly into the prior real body (it should also be a small white candle). The thrusting pattern should be a longer white candle that is stronger than the in-neck pattern, but still does not close above the middle of the prior black real body.
>
> It’s not important to remember the individual patterns. Instead, just remember the concept that the white candle should push more than halfway into the black candle’s real body to send out a more potent bottom reversal signal.
>
> A series of long lower shadows shown in the chart below at areas 1 and 2 denoted potential support near $56. But on September 8 Dayton-Hudson pummeled through this support as it opened near $54. The bears had gained control—or so they thought. By the end of September 8, the bulls had successfully propelled the stock to well above the prior session’s close. The candle lines of September 7 and 8 built a piercing pattern. A week after the piercing pattern, a hammer on September 16 reinforced the pattern’s support near $54. More confirmation emerged the week after the hammer with a series of long lower shadows.

> A rally that started from a bullish engulfing pattern in mid March in the next chart below displayed a hint of trouble with the March 24 spinning top near $59. A close over $59 on April 3 with a long white real body put the bulls back in charge, at least until the next session. On this session (April 4) the stock formed a variation of a dark-cloud cover. It was a variation of the dark-cloud cover because with that pattern we like to see an open on the second day above the prior session’s high. In this case, the open was above the prior day’s close. Nonetheless, since the black candle on April 4 pulled so deeply into the white candle’s real body, it increased the likelihood that this would be as effective as a more traditional dark-cloud cover.

> The piercing pattern on April 17 and 18 presaged a rally. The rally from this piercing pattern continued until another dark-cloud cover on April 24 and 25. This second dark-cloud cover could also be viewed as a variation of a classic dark-cloud cover. Why? Because the black real body did not push more than halfway into the white real body. Once again, while this wasn’t a classic dark-cloud cover, there were two factors that led me to believe it was just as negative as a traditional dark- cloud cover. Specifically, (1) the black candle on April 25 opened sharply above the prior day’s high and then closed under the prior day’s close, and (2) this pattern was also a failure, and hence confirmation of resistance at the early April dark-cloud cover.
> 
> This chart highlights the general concept that one should view a non-ideal candle pattern by (1) how it was formed and (2) within the overall market picture. These two factors will help us gauge if the less-than-perfect pattern could have the same implications as a more classicly defined candle pattern. It is this subjectivity that makes computer recognition of candle patterns so difficult. For example, the two dark-cloud covers discussed in this exhibit did not meet the classic definition of the dark-cloud cover, but I viewed them as dark-cloud covers because of how and where they were formed, as discussed in the prior paragraph.

> 
> With a piercing pattern that doesn’t push deeply into the prior black candle, I usually suggest waiting for confirmation with a higher close the session after the white candle. In the chart above (IBM), late in the morning of March 31, a white candle pushed into the black candle. Since it did not close above the middle black candle, it wasn’t a piercing pattern. It was a thrusting pattern. The higher close the session after this thrusting pattern helped reinforce that this could be a bottoming signal. Late in the session of March 31 another thrusting pattern was formed near $117. Normally with a thrusting pattern (as we saw earlier that day) one should wait for some bullish confirmation. But with this second thrusting pattern, because it confirmed a prior support area, one would need less bullish confirmation (i.e., less reason to wait for higher close the next session). As such, for active momentum traders, the close of the white candle of the second thrusting pattern could have been used as a buying opportunity. An exit signal was given with the bearish engulfing pattern early the next morning.

### Chapter 6. Stars

> One group of fascinating reversal patterns is those that include _stars_. A star is a small real body (white or black) that gaps away from the large real body preceding it. 
> 
> ![Stars: Uptrend and a Downtrend](/.attachments/star-down.up.png)
> 
> _Star in an Uptrend and a Downtrend_
> 
> In other words, the star’s real body can be within the prior session’s upper shadow; all that is needed is that the real bodies don’t overlap (there are some exceptions to this rule, which are addressed later in this section). If the star is a doji instead of a small real body, it is called a doji star. The star, especially the doji star, is a warning that the prior trend may be ending.
> 
> ![Stars: Doji in an Uptrend and a Downtrend](/.attachments/star-doji.png)
> 
> _Doji Star in an Uptrend and a Downtrend_
>
> The star’s small real body represents a stalemate between the bulls and bears. The bulls are obviously in charge in a briskly ascending market. With the emergence of a star in such an environment, it is a signal of a shift from the buyers being in control to a deadlock between the buying and selling forces. This dead-lock may have occurred either because of a diminution in the buying force or an increase in the selling pressure. Either way, the star tells us the rally’s prior power has slightly dissipated. This means the market is vulnerable to a setback.
> 
> The same is true, but in reverse, for a star in a downtrend (sometimes a star during a downtrend is labeled a _raindrop_). The long black candle during the downtrend visually reflects that the bears are in command. A change is seen in the advent of the star, which signals an environment in which the bulls and the bears are more in equilibrium. In other words, the downward energy has thus been cooled. This is not a favorable scenario for a continuation of the bear market.
> 
> The star is part of four reversal patterns including:
> 
> 1. the morning star;
> 2. the evening star;
> 3. the doji stars; and
> 4. the shooting star.

#### THE MORNING STAR

> ![Morning Star](/.attachments/star-morning.png)
> 
> _Morning Star_
> 
> The morning star, shown above, is a bottom reversal pattern. Its name is derived because, like the morning star (the nickname for the planet Mercury) that foretells the sunrise, it presages higher prices. There are three candle lines comprising this pattern:
>
> - _Candle 1_. An extended black real body. This pictorially proves that the bears are in command.
> 
> - _Candle 2_. A small real body that doesn’t touch the prior real body (these two lines comprise a basic star pattern). The small real body means sellers are losing the capacity to drive the market lower.
> 
> - _Candle 3_. The concluding candle of the morning star is a white real body that intrudes deeply into the first session’s black candle. This is the indication that the bulls have seized control.
> 
> The lowest low of the three lines that form this pattern should be support as shown by the dashed line.
> 
> An ideal morning star would have a gap between the second and third real bodies. From my experience, a lack of a gap does not seem to weaken the power of this formation. The decisive factor is that the second candle should be a spinning top and the third candle pushes well into the black candle.
> 
> ![Wheat - Weekly Continuation (Morning Star)](/.attachments/star-wheat.weekly.png)
> 
> _Wheat - Weekly Continuation (Morning Star)_
> 
> The chart shown above is an example of this. In late July/early August we see three candle lines that make up the requisite criteria of a morning star: a long black candle, a small real body, and then a tall white candle. Of course, this pattern has to follow a decline. An aspect that kept this from an ideal morning star pattern was that the third real body wrapped around the second candle. However, from my experience, even if the second and third candles overlap, it doesn’t mitigate the effectiveness of this pattern. In fact, the second and third lines of this morning star pattern created a bullish engulfing pattern.
> 
> This chart is also a good example of how candle charts will frequently give turning signals before the more traditional signals derived from a bar chart. A bear channel that began in February remained in force until the third quarter that year. The close over the top of the bear channel was the traditional Western signal that the downtrend had been broken. By using the light of the candles (via the morning star), we had obtained an early warning beacon of a turn many sessions prior to the break over the bear channel.
>
> A limitation with the morning star is that since this is a three-candle pattern, one has to wait until the close of the third session to complete the pattern. As is usually the case, if this third candle is a tall white one, we would get the signal well after the market already had a sharp bounce. In other words, the completion of the morning star may not present an attractive risk/ reward trading opportunity. An option is waiting for a correction to the morning star’s support area to start nibbling from the long side.
> 
> ![Merrill Lynch - Daily (Morning Star)](/.attachments/star-merrill.lynch-daily.png)
> 
> _Merrill Lynch - Daily (Morning Star)_
> 
> As shown in the chart above, there was a morning star in early February. If one bought on the completion of this pattern near $74, by the next day he or she would have had a loss. By waiting for a correction to anywhere near the low of the morning star (toward $65.50) before buying, a trader would decrease his or her risk since the stop would be under the low of the morning star. As this stock ascended, it did so along a rising support line. (Trend lines are the focus of Chapter 11.)
> 
> While the ideal morning and evening stars should have none of their three real bodies touching, there is even more flexibility to the definition of the morning star (and also the evening star) in markets where the open and close are either the same or close to one another. This would include:
> 
> 1. Foreign exchange markets where there is no official open and close.
> 
> 2. Many indexes such as the Semi-Conductor or Drug Indexes.
> 
> 3. Intraday charts. For instance, on a 15-minute chart the open of a 15-minute session is usually not much different from the close of the prior 15-minute session.
> 
> ![NASDAQ Composite Index - 15 Minutes (Morning Star)](/.attachments/star-nasdaq.15.minutes.png)
> 
> _NASDAQ Composite Index - 15 Minutes (Morning Star)_
> 
> Let’s use the intraday chart shown above to see an instance of the value of being flexible in interpreting the candle patterns. Mid-day on December 27 the index made a new low for the move and in doing so broke under the support from early that day of 3535/3530. The bears thus took control. But at 13:00 a small real body and the next session’s long white candle made a morning star. Notice how all three bodies touched one another (the open of the second candle was the same as the close of the first candle and the open of the third candle was the same as the close of the second session). Because this was an intraday chart where the open/close difference is usually minor, I still viewed this as a viable morning star. This pattern took on more credibility since the third candle, which finalized this pattern, also pushed the index back above the previously broken support area near 3530. When a market makes a new low and the bears can’t maintain these new lows, it is frequently a hint of a reversal.

#### THE EVENING STAR

> The _evening star_ is the bearish counterpart of the morning star pattern. It is aptly named because the evening star (the nick-name for the planet Venus) appears just before darkness sets in. Since the evening star is a top reversal, it should be acted upon if it arises after an uptrend. Three lines compose the evening star.
> 
> ![Star: Evening Star](/.attachments/star-evening.star.png)
> 
> _Evening Star_
> 
> The first is a long white real body, the next is a star. The star is the first hint of a top. The third line corroborates a top and completes the three-line pattern of the evening star. The third line is a black real body that closes sharply into the first period’s white real body. I like to compare the evening star pattern to a traffic light. The traffic light goes from green (the bullish white real body) to yellow (the star’s warning signal) to red (the black real body confirming the prior trend has stopped).
>
> In principle, an evening star should have a gap between the first and second real bodies and then another gap between the second and third real bodies. But, as detailed earlier in the section on the morning star, this second gap is rarely seen and is not necessary for the success of this pattern. The main concern should be the extent of the intrusion of the third day’s black real body into the first day’s white real body.
> 
> Analyzing the evening star more closely shows it furnishes a reversal signal not available with an island top.
> 
> ![Star: Western Island Top](/.attachments/star-western.island.top.png)
> 
> _Western Island Top_
> 
> For an island top, the low of session 2 has to be above the highs of sessions 1 and 3. However, the ideal evening star only requires real body 2 to be above the high of real bodies 1 and 3 to be a reversal signal.
> 
> Some factors increasing the likelihood that an evening or morning star could be a reversal would include:
> 
> 1. If there is no overlap among the first, second, and third real bodies.
> 
> 2. If the third candle closes deeply into the first candle’s real body.
> 
> 3. If there is light volume on the first candle session and heavy volume on the third candle session. This would show a reduction of the force for the prior trend and an increase in the direction force of the new trend.
> 
> The highs of the evening star become resistance as displayed by the dashed line shown in the illustration.

> As shown in the chart above, a classic evening star was completed in early January. This evening star had the ideal prerequisite of the three real bodies not intersecting. Intersecting the star portion (that is, the second candle line of the evening star pattern) was a hanging man line whose bearish confirmation came the next day. The descent from the evening star culminated a week later near 1210 at area A. The rally from A hesitated a week later via a doji near the resistance area created by the evening star. This doji hinted the rally was exhausting itself. (Dojis are discussed in Chapter 8.)
> 
> The next time the market rallied to this resistance in the first week of February, it formed a bearish engulfing pattern at B. I mention this bearish engulfing pattern to bring out the importance of trend in helping to define a candle pattern. I have discussed how a bearish engulfing pattern is when a black real body engulfs a white real body. There was a black real body at A that wrapped around a prior white candle. Was this a bearish engulfing pattern? No, because it came after a price decline; whereas a bearish engulfing, as a top reversal, needs a rally to reverse. This is why I define B as a bearish engulfing pattern, but not A.
> 
> Another doji in late February echoed continued supply near the evening star’s resistance level. The long black candle after this doji formed another evening star pattern. This evening star had a doji as a second candle line instead of a spinning top. This, is a special type of evening star called an _evening doji star_, which is discussed later in this section. The second evening star is an example where the second and third candles overlapped. From my experience this works as well as the more classic pattern in which none of the real bodies touch.
> 
> A challenge with some of the candle patterns is that by the time the pattern is completed, the market may be well off its highs or lows. The evening star, because of the need to wait for its completion with a long black real body, may give a reversal signal well after the market has already turned.

> As shown in this chart above, the high of the move was near $34, with the evening star's completion on the close of the third session at $31. As such, if one sold based on the evening star at $31, the risk would be to the high of evening star toward $34, There is no problem with a $3 risk if the target is many times that risk. Only then would it be an attractive risk/reward trade.
> 
> If this $3 risk is too large, one can improve the risk/reward aspect of this trade by waiting for a bounce to near the resistance area at the top of the evening star (of course, there is no guarantee of a bounce). In this example, two sessions after the evening star we got a $2 rebound which took the stock very close to its pivotal resistance at $34. After this stock resumed its decline, it moved into the April-May period. The shrinking real bodies presaged that chances for a turnaround had increased.

#### THE MORNING AND EVENING DOJI STAR

> An evening star that has a doji instead of a small real body as the second candle is called an _evening doji star_, as shown below.

> If there is an evening doji star in which the bottom shadow of the doji session does not overlap with the shadows of the first or third candles (that is, the shadows do not touch), it is considered a top reversal signal known as an _abandoned baby top_. This pattern is very rare.

> The same is true, only in reverse, for a bottom. Specifically, if there is a doji that has a gap before and after it (where the shadows do not touch), it should be a bottom. This pattern is referred to as an _abandoned baby bottom_. It is also extremely rare. To give an idea on the rarity of this pattern, consider that the abandoned baby is the same as a Western island top or bottom where the island session would be a doji.

> Because the middle line of the morning star in the chart immediately above was a doji, this is an example of a morning doji star. Here we see how the third candle line slightly overlapped the second real body (i.e., doji line). The ascent from this morning doji star ran out of force with the series of spinning tops (a.k.a. small real bodies). As is the case with the traditional morning star, the lowest low of the morning doji star (in this case near $92) should act as a base on pullbacks. That is what happened in mid October as the morning doji star held its ground as support. The doji portion of the morning star had long upper and lower shadows. This further reflects that the market is losing its, prior directional bias (which in this example was down). This doji, called a _long-legged doji_, is discussed in Chapter 8.

An evening doji star is shown in the chart above. Ideally, I would have liked to see the last black candle of this pattern close more into the white real body of the first session. However, the fact, that this occurred at a “century” mark of $400 (a “century mark" is a round $100 figure that can become support or resistance) and then the failure to push over the resistance area of this pattern a few days later (via a long upper shadow candle) helped substantiate this as an evening doji star. This $400 level remained an upside barrier over the next few weeks with the long black real body on November 30 providing the “death blow” in forming a bearish engulfing pattern.

In the chart above an evening doji star pattern formed in late February. Because the market gapped before and then after the doji, this pattern was an abandoned baby top. Also troubling about this particular scenario was the third day's abandoned baby (gapped down). This showed the prior day's new high close above $56 could not be sustained. When a new high is made and the bulls can’t maintain the new highs, it often had bearish consequences. This is discussed in Chapter 11.

The ideal abandoned baby bottom has a doji as the second real body. In the chart of "Soybean Oil - Daily" shown above, there was a diminutive real body as the second session instead of the requisite doji needed for the ideal abandoned baby. However, the real body was so small that it could be viewed as a doji and thus a variation of this pattern (this second session was also a hammer). The advance from this bottom reversal persisted until a series of longer upper shadows (at the arrows) alerted us that the bulls were not calling all the shots. This further buttressed the outlook that the market had hit a ceiling. A rebound commenced after the bullish engulfing pattern of April 6 and 7.
> 
> 
> ![Star: Shooting Star](/.attachments/star-shooting.star.png)
> 
> _Shooting Star_
> 
> The _shooting star_ has a small real body at the lower end of its range with a long upper shadow. We can see how this line’s name is derived. It looks like a shooting star with its long tail blazing across the sky. The Japanese aptly say that the shooting star shows trouble overhead. Since it is one session, it is usually not a major reversal signal as is the bearish engulfing pattern or evening star. Nor do I view the shooting, star as pivotal resistance as I do with the two previously mentioned patterns.
> 
> As with all stars, the color of the real body is not important. The shooting star pictorially tells us that the market opened near its low, then strongly rallied and finally backed off to close near the opening. In other words, that session's rally could not be sustained.
> 
> Since the shooting star is a bearish reversal signal, it must come after a rally. An ideal shooting star has a real body that gaps away from the prior real body. Nonetheless, as will be seen in several chart examples, this gap is not always necessary. A lack of a rising gap is more of a reason to be negative on the shooting star. This is because, as addressed in Chapter 7, an ascending gap, called a “rising window” in Japan, is a positive signal. As such, I am more comfortable saying the trend could be turning less bullish if the shooting star has no gap. Ifa shooting star-shaped candle line comes after a downturn, it could be a bullish signal, Such a line is called an inverted hammer. The inverted hammer line is discussed later in this chapter,

> If the chart shown above were formed as a bar chart instead of a candle chart, sessions A, B, and C would reflect a healthy environment because they each had higher highs, higher lows, and higher closes. But from a candle charting perspective, we get visual warnings with these sessions of trouble overhead. Specifically, the bearish upper shadows at A, B, and C strongly indicate a stock that is, as the Japanese say, “rising in agony.” Final confirmation of a top came at session C, the shooting star. You may have noticed that a gravestone doji looks like a shooting star. The gravestone doji is a specific version of a shooting star. The shooting star has a small real body but the gravestone doji—being a doji—has no real body. The gravestone doji is thus more bearish than a shooting star.

In the chart shown above, the first shooting star—in what was to be a series of shooting stars—arose on March 10 at $34.50. A few weeks later, three consecutive shooting stars appeared at this same $34.50 level. This told us that try as they might, each time the bulls had been able to push the stock up to $34.50, they couldn’t sustain these intraday highs into the close. In other words, the shooting stars were visually showing us that the market was rejecting higher prices. When, as in this example, we get signal after signal at the same price level, it reinforces that resistance area. In this case the confluence of shooting stars dramatically increased the likelihood that this would be a reversal. Of course, if the bulls had enough force to close this, stock over the highs of the shooting stars, then we would reassess any bearish views.

> A shooting star early on August 22 in the chart shown above reinforced trouble near $304 since it was the third consecutive session that failed there. The 30-minute period following the shooting star gave more proof of a top since it produced a bearish engulfing pattern. Corning then settled into a box range defined by the support of the hammer at $294 from late on August 23 (which was successfully defended with another hammer early the next day). The rally from the second hammer at $294 hit a ceiling with the shooting star’s resistance near $304.

> The illustration show above demonstrates how an _inverted hammer_ has the same form as a shooting star with its long upper shadow and small real body at the lower end of the range. The only difference between the shooting star and inverted hammer is that the inverted hammer comes after a decline. As a result, while the shooting star is a top reversal line, the inverted hammer is a bottom reversal line. The color of the inverted hammer’s real body doesn’t matter. This is similar in concept to the hammer and hanging man concept (see Chapter 4) in which the same shape line is bullish or bearish depending on the preceding trend.

A bearish engulfing pattern in mid June in the chart shown above developed into resistance a few days later. The descent from this failure at resistance near $82 culminated with an inverted hammer. This line was confirmed by a higher opening the next day, and especially with that session's higher close. The rally from this inverted hammer continued into the week of July 12 when a shooting star implied that the bearish engulfing pattern’s resistance was still in force.
