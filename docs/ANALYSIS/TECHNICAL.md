# Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is a method used by traders and investors to evaluate and predict future price movements in financial markets. It involves the use of various tools and indicators to make informed decisions. Here's a list of some common tools and indicators used in technical analysis:

1. **Candlestick Charts**: Candlestick charts display price movements over a specified time period, providing information on open, high, low, and close prices.

2. **Moving Averages (MAs)**: These include Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) that help smooth out price data over a specified period, revealing trends.

3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: RSI measures the speed and change of price movements, helping identify overbought or oversold conditions.

4. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages.

5. **Bollinger Bands**: Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band (SMA) and upper and lower bands that help identify volatility and potential reversal points.

6. **Stochastic Oscillator**: It compares the current price to its price range over a specified period, identifying overbought or oversold conditions.

7. **Fibonacci Retracement**: Based on the Fibonacci sequence, this tool is used to identify potential support and resistance levels.

8. **Ichimoku Cloud**: This indicator offers information about support and resistance levels, as well as the overall market trend.

9. **Volume Analysis**: Volume indicators like On-Balance Volume (OBV) can help confirm trends by analyzing trading volumes.

10. **Chart Patterns**: These include common patterns like head and shoulders, double tops and bottoms, flags, and triangles that can signal potential price movements.

11. **Support and Resistance Levels**: Identifying key price levels where assets tend to find support or resistance.

12. **Parabolic SAR**: The Parabolic Stop and Reverse indicator helps traders identify potential entry and exit points.

13. **Average True Range (ATR)**: ATR measures market volatility by calculating the average range between the daily high and low.

14. **Elliott Wave Theory**: A more complex method that seeks to identify patterns in price movements based on a wave theory.

15. **Pivot Points**: These levels indicate potential support and resistance levels based on the previous day's price action.

16. **Williams %R**: This oscillator helps identify overbought or oversold conditions and potential reversals.

17. **Market Sentiment Indicators**: These can include the put-call ratio and the VIX (Volatility Index) to gauge market sentiment.

18. **Candlestick Patterns**: Specific candlestick formations like doji, hammers, and shooting stars can provide insights into market sentiment.

19. **Gaps**: Price gaps on charts can indicate significant price movements and potential areas of support or resistance.

20. **Hull Moving Average**: A more responsive moving average that aims to reduce lag.

These are just some of the many tools and indicators used in technical analysis. Traders often combine multiple indicators to make more informed trading decisions. Keep in mind that technical analysis is not a guaranteed method for predicting market movements, and it's important to use it in conjunction with other forms of analysis and risk management.

### Chapter 6. Understand Technical Analysis I

> While it is hard to assess the forecasting value of technical analysis, there is another simple reason that using technical analysis is inherently risky (assuming you are a human being). Humans are designed to see patterns. It’s how our biology works. It allows us to simplify and process a complex world. _It is called apophenia: the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns within random data._
> 
> ...
> 
> I strongly advise you to learn about technical analysis and use it as a tool—but consider it a risk management and tactical tool, not a trade selection or forecasting tool.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Occam’s Razor states that among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Other, more complicated solutions may ultimately prove correct, but—in the absence of certainty—the fewer assumptions that are made, the better._
> 
> When using technical analysis as a risk management and tactical tool, simpler is always better.
> 
> ...
> 
> My trading strategy is short-term so I use 20-period, 55-period, 100-period, and 200-period moving averages on 10-minute and 1-hour charts. I prefer the 55-hour and 200-hour moving averages as fast and slow indicators for my trading but whether you use 55-hour or 100-hour or 200-hour, the idea and results will be about the same.

> First, the basics of candlestick construction. The difference between the open and the close is called the body of the candlestick. That is the fat part that is black and white (some systems use green and red in place of black and white). The tails outside the body are called the shadow of the candlestick and represent the full range that traded outside of the OPEN/CLOSE range.
> 
> When the candle is green or white, it means the currency pair went up on the day and if it is red or black the currency pair went down. So, to recap, the body is the open to close range, the color defines if the currency pair rose or fell, and the shadows (sometimes called wicks, as in candle wicks) are the intraday extension outside the open-to-close range.

### Chapter 1. Philosophy of Technical Analysis

> Technical analysis is the study of market action, primarily through the use of charts, for the purpose of forecasting future price trends.
> 
> ...
> 
> There are three premises on which the technical approach is based:
> 
> 1. Market action discounts everything.
> 2. Prices move in trends.
> 3. History repeats itself.
> 
> ...
> 
> The technician believes that anything that can possibly affect the price—fundamentally, politically, psychologically, or otherwise—is actually reflected in the price of that market. It follows, therefore, that a study of price action is all that is required.
> 
> ...
> 
> There is a corollary to the premise that prices move in trends—_a trend in motion is more likely to continue than to reverse_.
> 
> ...
> 
> Since these patterns have worked well in the past, it is assumed that they will continue to work well in the future. They are based on the study of human psychology, which tends not to change. Another way of saying this last premise—that history repeats itself—is that the key to understanding the future lies in a study of the past, or that the future is just a repetition of the past.
> 
> While technical analysis concentrates on the study of market action, fundamental analysis focuses on the economic forces of supply and demand that cause prices to move higher, lower, or stay the same. ... The intrinsic value is what the fundamentals indicate something is actually worth based on the law of supply and demand.
> 
> ...
> 
> _The fundamentalist studies the cause of market movement, while the technician studies the effect_.
> 
> ...
> 
> Usually at the beginning of important market moves, the fundamentals do not explain or support what the market seems to be doing.
> 
> ...
> 
> Chart reading becomes a shortcut form of fundamental analysis. The reverse, however, is not true. Fundamental analysis does not include a study of price action. It is possible to trade financial markets using just the technical approach. It is doubtful that anyone could trade off the fundamentals alone with no consideration of the technical side of the market.
> 
> ... Because of the high leverage factor in the futures markets, timing is especially crucial in that arena.
> 
> ... A “buy and hold” strategy doesn’t apply to the futures arena. Both the technical and the fundamental approach can be used in the first phase—the forecasting process. However, the question of timing, of determining specific entry and exit points, is almost purely technical. Therefore, considering the steps the trader must go through before making a market commitment, it can be seen that the correct application of technical principles becomes indispensable at some point in the process, even if fundamental analysis was applied in the earlier stages of the decision. ...
> 
> One of the great strengths of technical analysis is its adaptability to virtually any trading medium and time dimension. There is no area of trading in either stocks or futures where these principles do not apply.
> 
> ...
> 
> The fundamentalist, however, who tends to specialize in only one group, doesn’t have that kind of flexibility.
> 
> ...
> 
> Rising commodity prices generally hint at a stronger economy and rising inflationary pressure. Falling commodity prices usually warn that the economy is slowing along with inflation. ... As a result, charts of commodity markets like gold and oil, along with Treasury Bonds, can tell us a lot about the strength or weakness of the economy and inflationary expectations. ... Even more impressive is the fact that trends in these futures markets usually show up long before they are reflected in traditional economic indicators that are released on a monthly or quarterly basis, and usually tell us what has already happened.
> 
> ...
> 
> The pricing structure in futures is much more complicated than in stocks. Each commodity is quoted in different units and increments. Grain markets, for example, are quoted in cents per bushel, livestock markets in cents per pound, gold and silver in dollars per ounce, and interest rates in basis points. The trader must learn the contract details of each market: which exchange it is traded on, how each contract is quoted, what the minimum and maximum price increments are, and what these price increments are worth.
> 
> Unlike stocks, futures contracts have expiration dates.
> 
> ...
> 
> All futures are traded on margin, which is usually less than 10% of the value of the contract. ... Relatively small price moves in either direction tend to become magnified in their impact on overall trading results. For this reason, it is possible to make or lose large sums of money very quickly in futures. Because a trader puts up only 10% of the value of the contract as margin, then a 10% move in either direction will either double the trader’s money or wipe it out. ...
> 
> From the standpoint of technical analysis, the high leverage factor makes timing in the futures markets much more critical than it is in stocks. The correct timing of entry and exit points is crucial in futures trading and much more difficult and frustrating than market analysis. Largely for this reason, technical trading skills become indispensable to a successful futures trading program.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Timing is everything in futures trading_. Determining the correct direction of the market only solves a portion of the trading problem. If the timing of the entry point is off by a day, or sometimes even minutes, it can mean the difference between a winner or a loser. It’s bad enough to be on the wrong side of the market and lose money. Being on the right side of the market and still losing money is one of the most frustrating and unnerving aspects of futures trading. It goes without saying that timing is almost purely technical in nature, because the fundamentals rarely change on a day-to-day basis.
> 
> ...
> 
> Technical analysis in stocks relies much more heavily on the use of _sentiment indicators and flow of funds analysis_. Sentiment indicators monitor the performance of different groups such as odd lotters, mutual funds, and floor specialists. Enormous importance is placed on sentiment indicators that measure the overall market bullishness and bearishness on the theory that the majority opinion is usually wrong. _Flow of funds_ analysis refers to the cash position of different groups, such as mutual funds or large institutional accounts. The thinking here is that the larger the cash position, the more funds that are available for stock purchases.
> 
> ...
> 
> The _Random Walk Theory_, developed and nurtured in the academic community, claims that price changes are “serially independent” and that price history is not a reliable indicator of future price direction. In a nutshell, price movement is random and unpredictable. The theory is based on the _efficient market hypothesis_, which holds that prices fluctuate randomly about their intrinsic value. It also holds that the best market strategy to follow would be a simple “buy and hold” strategy as opposed to any attempt to “beat the market.”
> 
> ...
> 
> ... However, the idea that markets are random is totally rejected by the technical community. If the markets were truly random, no forecasting technique would work.

### Chapter 2. Dow Theory

> Charles Dow and his partner Edward Jones founded Dow Jones & Company in 1882. Most technicians and students of the markets concur that much of what we call technical analysis today has its origins in theories first proposed by Dow around the turn of the century. Dow published his ideas in a series of editorials he wrote for the Wall Street Journal. Most technicians today recognize and assimilate Dow’s basic ideas, whether or not they recognize the source. Dow Theory still forms the cornerstone of the study of technical analysis, even in the face of today’s sophisticated computer technology, and the proliferation of newer and supposedly better technical indicators.
> 
> On July 3, 1884, Dow published the first stock market average composed of the closing prices of eleven stocks: nine railroad companies and two manufacturing firms. Dow felt that these eleven stocks provided a good indication of the economic health of the country. In 1897, Dow determined that two separate indices would better represent that health, and created a 12 stock industrial index and a 20 stock rail index. By 1928 the industrial index had grown to include 30 stocks, the number at which it stands today.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dow applied his theoretical work to the stock market averages that he created; namely the Industrials and the Rails. However, most of his analytical ideas apply equally well to all market averages.
> 
> ...
> 
> Sound familiar? The idea that the markets reflect every possible knowable factor that affects overall supply and demand is one of the basic premises of technical theory ... The theory applies to market averages, as well as it does to individual markets, and even makes allowances for “acts of God.” While the markets cannot anticipate events such as earthquakes and various other natural calamities, they quickly discount such occurrences, and almost instantaneously assimilate their affects into the price action.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dow believed that the laws of action and reaction apply to the markets just as they do to the physical universe. He wrote, “Records of trading show that in many cases when a stock reaches top it will have a moderate decline and then go back again to near the highest figures. If after such a move, the price again recedes, it is liable to decline some distance” ...
> 
> Dow considered a trend to have three parts, _primary_, _secondary_, and _minor_, which he compared to the tide, waves, and ripples of the sea. The primary trend represents the tide, the secondary or intermediate trend represents the waves that make up the tide, and the minor trends behave like ripples on the waves.
> 
> ...
> 
> Dow focused his attention on primary or major trends, which he felt usually take place in three distinct phases: an accumulation phase, a public participation phase, and a distribution phase. ... The distribution phase takes place when newspapers begin to print increasingly bullish stories ...
> 
> ...
> 
> Dow, in referring to the Industrial and Rail Averages, meant that no important bull or bear market signal could take place unless both averages gave the same signal, thus confirming each other. He felt that both averages must exceed a previous secondary peak to confirm the inception or continuation of a bull market. He did not believe that the signals had to occur simultaneously, but recognized that a shorter length of time between the two signals provided stronger confirmation. When the two averages diverged from one another, Dow assumed that the prior trend was still maintained. ...
> 
> Dow recognized volume as a secondary but important factor in confirming price signals. Simply stated, _volume should expand or increase in the direction of the major trend_. In a major uptrend, volume would then increase as prices move higher, and diminish as prices fall. In a downtrend, volume should increase as prices drop and diminish as they rally. Dow considered volume a secondary indicator. He based his actual buy and sell signals entirely on closing prices.
> 
> ...
> 
> It relates a physical law to market movement, which states that an object in motion (in this case a trend) tends to continue in motion until some external force causes it to change direction.
>

> 
> ![Basic Tenets: Failure Swing](/.attachments/basic.tent-failure.swing.png)
> 
> _Failure Swing. The failure of the peak at C to overcome A, followed by the violation of the low at B, constitutes a “sell” signal at S._
> 
> ![Basic Tenets: Nonfailure Swing](/.attachments/basic.tenet-nonfailure.swing.png)
> 
> _Nonfailure Swing. Notice that C exceeds A before falling below B. Some Dow theorists would see a “sell” signal at S1, while others would need to see a lower high at E before turning bearish at S2._

> Dow relied exclusively on closing prices. ...
> 
> ![Basic Tenet: Failure Swing Bottom](/.attachments/basic.tenet.buy.signal.png)
>
> _Failure Swing Bottom. The “buy” signal takes place when point B is exceeded (at B1)._
> 
> ...
> 
> In response to this criticism, traders must remember that Dow never intended to anticipate trends; rather he sought to recognize the emergence of major bull and bear markets and to capture the large middle portion of important market moves. ...
> 
> Dow apparently never intended to use his theory to forecast the direction of the stock market. He felt its real value was to use stock market direction as a barometric reading of general business conditions. We can only marvel at Dow’s vision and genius. In addition to formulating a great deal of today’s price forecasting methodology, he was among the first to recognize the usefulness of stock market averages as a leading economic indicator.
> 
> ... 
> 
> ... The standard definition of a trend, the classification of a trend into three categories and phases, the principles of confirmation and divergence, the interpretation of volume, and the use of percentage retracements (to name a few), all derive, in one way or another, from Dow Theory.

### Chapter 4. Basic Concepts of Trend

> The concept of _trend_ is absolutely essential to the technical approach to market analysis. All of the tools used by the chartist—support and resistance levels, price patterns, moving averages, trendlines, etc.—have the sole purpose of helping to measure the trend of the market for the purpose of participating in that trend. We often hear such familiar expressions as “always trade in the direction of the trend,” “never buck the trend,” or “the trend is your friend.” So let’s spend a little time to define what a trend is and classify it into a few categories.
> 
> In a general sense, the trend is simply the direction of the market, which way it’s moving. But we need a more precise definition with which to work. First of all, markets don’t generally move in a straight line in any direction. Market moves are characterized by a series of _zigzags_. These zigzags resemble a series of successive waves with fairly obvious peaks and troughs. _It is the direction of those peaks and troughs that constitutes market trend_.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... trend is usually broken down into the three categories mentioned in the previous chapter. Those three categories are the _major_, _intermediate_, and _near term trends_.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Classification](/.attachments/chart.trends.classification.png)
> 
> _Example of the three degrees of trend: major, secondary, and near term. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 show the major uptrend. Wave 2-3 represents a secondary correction within the major uptrend. Each secondary wave in turn divides into near term trends. For example, secondary wave 2-3 divides into minor waves A-B-C._
>
> ![Chart Trends: Classification - Real Life Visualization](/.attachments/chart.trends.classification-real.png)
> 
> _The major trend (over a year) is up during 1997. A short term correction occurred during March. An intermediate correction lasted from August to November (three months). The intermediate correction broke down into three short term trends._
> 
> Quite a bit of misunderstanding arises because of different traders’ perceptions as to what is meant by a trend. To long term position traders, a few days’ to a few weeks’ price action might be insignificant. To a day trader, a two or three day advance might constitute a major uptrend. It’s especially important, then, to understand the different degrees of trend and to make sure that all involved in a transaction are talking about the same ones.
> 
> As a general statement, most trend-following approaches focus on the intermediate trend, which may last for several months. The near term trend is used primarily for timing purposes. In an intermediate uptrend, short term setbacks would be used to initiate long positions.
> 
> ...
> 
> The troughs, or reaction lows, are called _support_. The term is self-explanatory and indicates that support is a level or area on the chart _under the market_ where buying interest is sufficiently strong to overcome selling pressure. As a result, a decline is halted and prices turn back up again.
> 
> _Resistance_ is the opposite of support and represents a price level or area _over the market_ where selling pressure overcomes buying pressure and a price advance is turned back.
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Resistance and Support](/.attachments/chart.trends.resistance.support.png)
> 
> _Shows rising support and resistance levels in uptrend. Points 2 and 4 are support levels which are usually previous reaction lows. Points 1 and 3 are resistance levels, usually marked by previous peaks._
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Resistance and Support - Down Trend](/.attachments/chart.trends.resistance.support.downtrend.png)
> 
> _Shows support and resistance in a downtrend._
> 
> In an uptrend, the resistance levels represent pauses in that uptrend and are usually exceeded at some point. In a downtrend, support levels are not sufficient to stop the decline permanently, but are able to check it at least temporarily.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... If the support level is violated, then a trend _reversal_ from up to down is likely.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Whenever a support or resistance level is penetrated by a significant amount, they reverse their roles and become the opposite_. In other words, a resistance level becomes a support level and support becomes resistance.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Top Reversal](/.attachments/chart.trends.top.reversal.png)
> 
> _Example of a trend reversal. The failure of prices at point 5 to exceed the previous peak at point 3 followed by a downside violation of the previous low at point 4 constitutes a downside trend reversal. This type of pattern is called a double top._
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Bottom Reversal](/.attachments/chart.trends.bottom.reversal.png)
> 
> _Example of a bottom reversal pattern. Usually the first sign of a bottom is the ability of prices at point 5 to hold above the previous low at point 3. The bottom is confirmed when the peak at 4 is overcome._
> 
> ...
> 
> _The longer the period of time that prices trade in a support or resistance area, the more significant that area becomes_. For example, if prices trade sideways for three weeks in a congestion area before moving higher, that support area would be more important than if only three days of trading had occurred.
> 
> _Volume is another way to measure the significance of support and resistance_. If a support level is formed on heavy volume, this would indicate that a large number of units changed hands, and would mark that support level as more important than if very little trading had taken place. Point and figure charts that measure the intraday trading activity are especially useful in identifying these price levels where most of the trading took place and, consequently, where support and resistance will be most likely to function.
> 
> _A third way to determine the significance of a support or resistance area is how recently the trading took place_. Because we are dealing with the reaction of traders to market movement and to positions that they have already taken or failed to take, it stands to reason that the more recent the activity, the more potent it becomes.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Chart analysis is actually a study of human psychology and the reactions of traders to changing market conditions. ...
> 
> ...
> 
> There is a tendency for round numbers to stop advances or declines. Traders tend to think in terms of important round numbers, such as 10, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100 (and multiples of 1000), as price objectives and act accordingly. These round numbers, therefore, will often act as “psychological” support or resistance levels. A trader can use this information to begin taking profits as an important round number is approached.
> 
> ...
> 
> One trading application of this principle is to _avoid placing trading orders right at these obvious round numbers_. ... As a general rule, _avoid placing protective stops at obvious round numbers_.

> 
> ...
> 
> It was mentioned earlier that support and resistance levels became the opposite once violated. The same principle holds true of trendlines. In other words, an up trendline (a support line) will usually become a resistance line once it’s decisively broken. A down trendline (a resistance line) will often become a support line once it’s decisively broken. This is why it’s usually a good idea to project all trendlines as far out to the right on the chart as possible even after they’ve been broken.
>
> This brings us to another interesting use of the trendline—the _fan principle_. ... The term “fan principle” derives from the appearance of the lines that gradually flatten out, resembling a fan. _The important point to remember here is that the breaking of the third line is the valid trend reversal signal_.
> 
> ![Chart Trends: Fan Principle - Breaking Up trend](/.attachments/chart.trends.fan.principle-1.png)

> 
> ...
> 
> In examining the three lines in the fan principle, it’s interesting to note how often the number three shows up in the study of technical analysis and the important role it plays in so many technical approaches. For example, the fan principle uses three lines; major bull and bear markets usually have three major phases (Dow Theory and Elliott Wave Theory); there are three kinds of gaps (to be covered shortly); some of the more commonly known reversal patterns, such as the triple top and the head and shoulders, have three prominent peaks; there are three different classifications of trend (major, secondary, and minor) and three trend directions (up, down, and sideways); among the generally accepted continuation patterns, there are three types of triangles—the symmetrical, ascending, and descending; there are three principle sources of information—price, volume, and open interest. For whatever the reason, the number three plays a very prominent role throughout the entire field of technical analysis.

> 
> ![Chart Trends: Relative Steepness](/.attachments/chart.trends.steepness.png)
> 
> _Most valid trendlines rise at an angle approximating 45 degrees (see line 2). If the trendline is too steep (line 1), it usually indicates that the rate of ascent is not sustainable. A trendline that is too flat (line 3) suggests that the uptrend is too weak and probably suspect. Many technicians use 45 degree lines from previous tops or bottoms as major trendlines._
> 
> ...
> 
> In the case of an accelerating trend, sometimes several trendlines may have to be drawn at increasingly steeper angles. In my experience, however, where steeper trendlines become necessary, it is best to resort to another tool—_the moving average_—which is the same as a curvilinear trendline. One of the advantages of having access to several different types of technical indicators is being able to choose the one most appropriate for a given situation. All of the techniques covered in this book work well in certain situations, but not so well in others. By having an arsenal of tools to fall back on, the technician can quickly switch from one tool to another that might work better in a given situation. An accelerated trend is one of those cases where a moving average would be more useful than a series of steeper and steeper trendlines.
> 
> ...
>
> The _channel line_, or the _return line_ as it is sometimes called, is another useful variation of the trendline technique. Sometimes prices trend between two parallel lines—the basic trendline and the channel line. Obviously, when this is the case and when the analyst recognizes that a channel exists, this knowledge can be used to profitable advantage.

> 
> The breaking of the major trendline indicates an important change in trend.

The failure of prices to reach the top of the channel (at point 5 in chart above) may be an early warning that the trend is turning, and increases the odds that the other line (the basic up trendline) will be broken. As a general rule of thumb, the failure of any move within an established price channel to reach one side of the channel usually indicates that the trend is shifting, and increases the likelihood that the other side of the channel will be broken.

> 
> _When the upper channel line is broken (as in wave 5), many chartists will redraw the basic up trendline parallel to the new upper channel line. In other words, line 4-6 is drawn parallel to line 3-5. Because the uptrend is accelerating, it stands to reason that the basic up trendline will do likewise._

> 
> _When prices fail to reach the upper channel line, and a down trendline is drawn over the two declining peaks (line 3-5), a tentative channel line can be drawn from the low at point 4 parallel to line 3-5. The lower channel line sometimes indicates where initial support will be evident._
> 
> Channel lines have measuring implications. _Once a breakout occurs from an existing price channel, prices usually travel a distance equal to the width of the channel_. Therefore, the user has to simply measure the width of the channel and then project that amount from the point at which either trendline is broken.
> 
> It should always be kept in mind, however, that of the two lines, the basic trendline is by far the more important and the more reliable. The channel line is a secondary use of the trendline technique. But the use of the channel line works often enough to justify its inclusion in the chartist’s toolkit.

> ... after a particular market move, prices retrace a portion of the previous trend before resuming the move in the original direction. These countertrend moves tend to fall into certain predictable percentage parameters. The best known application of the phenomenon is the 50% _retracement_. ...
> 
> Besides the 50% retracement, there are minimum and maximum percentage parameters that are also widely recognized—_the one-third and the two-thirds retracements_. In other words, the price trend can be divided into thirds. Usually, a minimum retracement is about 33% and a maximum about 66%. What this means is that, in a correction of a strong trend, the market usually retraces at least a third of the previous move. This is very useful information for a number of reasons. If a trader is looking for a buying area under the market, he or she can just compute a 33-50% zone on the chart and use that price zone as a general frame of reference for buying opportunities.

> 
> The maximum retracement parameter is 66%, which becomes an especially critical area. If the prior trend is to be maintained, the correction must stop at the two-thirds point. This then becomes a relatively low risk buying area in an uptrend or selling area in a downtrend. If prices move beyond the two-thirds point, the odds then favor a trend reversal rather than just a retracement. The move usually then retraces the entire 100% of the prior trend.
> 
> You may have noticed that the three percentage retracement parameters we’ve mentioned so far—50%, 33%, and 66%—are taken right from the original Dow Theory. When we get to the Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci ratios, we will see that followers of that approach use percentage retracements of 38% and 62%. I prefer to combine both approaches for a minimum retracement zone of 33-38% and a maximum zone of 62-66%. Some technicians round off these numbers even further to arrive at a 40-60% retracement zone.

> _The three horizontal lines mark the 38%, 50%, and 62% retracement levels measured from the April 1997 low to the August high. The first decline fell to the 38% line, the second decline to the 62% line, and the third near the 50% line. Most corrections will find support in the 38% to 50% retracement zones. The 38% and 62% lines are Fibonacci retracements and are popular with chartists._

Fibonacci retracement levels are used in technical analysis because of their perceived significance in identifying potential levels of support and resistance in financial markets. The Fibonacci sequence and its associated ratios are believed to reflect natural patterns and occurrences found in various aspects of life, including financial markets.

The significance lies in the observation that these ratios, derived from the Fibonacci sequence (like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, etc.), tend to correspond with levels where price corrections often occur within a larger trend. Here are a few reasons why they are used:

1. **Nature's Presence**: The Fibonacci sequence and ratios appear in natural phenomena, from the arrangement of leaves on plants to the proportions of the human body. This prevalence in nature leads some to believe that these ratios may also influence market behavior.

2. **Psychological Levels**: Many traders and analysts believe that these Fibonacci levels are psychologically important to market participants. As a result, when these levels are reached, traders may buy or sell, causing price reactions.

3. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**: The widespread use of Fibonacci retracements by traders and analysts means that these levels often become self-fulfilling prophecies. As more people use and act upon these levels, they can impact market behavior.

4. **Support and Resistance**: The levels derived from the Fibonacci sequence are believed to represent potential areas of support (where prices may stop falling) or resistance (where prices may stop rising) within a larger trend.

However, it's important to note that while Fibonacci retracements are widely used, they are not foolproof indicators. Market movements are influenced by various factors, and these levels should ideally be used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools and indicators for more robust trading decisions.

> Speaking of thirds, let’s touch on another technique that combines the trendline with percentage retracements—speedlines. This technique, developed by Edson Gould, is actually an adaptation of the idea of dividing the trend into thirds. The main difference from the percentage retracement concept is that the speed resistance lines (or speedlines) measure the rate of ascent or descent of a trend (in other words, its speed).
> 
> To construct a bullish _speedline_, find the highest point in the current uptrend. From that high point on the chart, a vertical line is drawn toward the bottom of the chart to where the trend began. That vertical line is then divided into thirds. A trendline is then drawn from the beginning of the trend through the two points marked off on the vertical line, representing the one-third and two-thirds points.
> 
> In a downtrend, just reverse the process. Measure the vertical distance from the low point in the downtrend to the beginning of the trend, and draw two lines from the beginning of the trend through the one-third and two-thirds points on the vertical line.

> 
> _Examples of speed resistance lines in an uptrend. The vertical distance from the peak to the beginning of the trend is divided into thirds. Two trendlines are then drawn from point 1 through points 2 and 3. The upper line is the 2/3 speedline and the lower, the 1/3. The lines should act as support during market corrections. When they’re broken, they revert to resistance lines on bounces. Sometimes these speedlines intersect price action._
> 
> Each time a new high is set in an uptrend or a new low in a downtrend, a new set of lines must be drawn (because there is now a new high or low point). Because the _speedlines_ are drawn from the beginning of the trend to the one-third and two-thirds points, those trendlines may sometimes move through some of the price action. This is one case where trendlines are not drawn under lows or over highs, but actually through the price action.
> 
> ...
> 
> Charting software also allows the drawing of _Gann_ and _Fibonacci_ fan lines. _Fibonacci_ fan lines are drawn in the same fashion as the speedline. Except that Fibonacci lines are drawn at 38% and 62% angles. _Gann_ lines (named after the legendary commodity trader, W.D. Gann) are trendlines drawn from prominent tops or bottoms at specific geometric angles. The most important Gann line is drawn at a 45 degree angle from a peak or trough. Steeper Gann lines can be drawn during an uptrend at 63 3⁄ 4 degree and 75 degree angles. Flatter Gann lines can be drawn at 26 1⁄ 4 and 15 degree lines. It’s possible to draw as many as nine different Gann lines.
> 
> Gann and Fibonacci lines are used in the same way as speedlines. They are supposed to provide support during downward corrections. When one line is broken, prices will usually fall to the next lower line. Gann lines are somewhat controversial. Even if one of them works, you can’t be sure in advance which one it will be. Some chartists question the validity of drawing geometric trendlines at all.
> 
> ... _internal trendlines_ are drawn through the price action and connect as many internal peaks or troughs as possible. Some chartists develop a good eye for this type of trendline and find them useful. The problem with internal trendlines is that their drawing is very subjective; whereas the rules for drawing of more traditional trendlines along the extreme highs and lows are more exact.
> 
> ...
> 
> A _reversal day_ takes place either at a top or a bottom. The generally accepted definition of a _top reversal day_ is the setting of a new high in an uptrend, followed by a lower close on the same day. In other words, prices set a new high for a given upmove at some point during the day (usually at or near the opening) then weaken and actually close lower than the previous day’s closing. A _bottom reversal day_ would be a new low during the day followed by a higher close.
> 
> ...
> 
> The bottom reversal day is sometimes referred to as a _selling climax_. This is usually a dramatic turnaround at the bottom of a down move where all the discouraged longs have finally been forced out of the market on heavy volume. The subsequent absence of selling pressure creates a vacuum over the market, which prices quickly rally to fill. The selling climax is one of the more dramatic examples of the reversal day and, while it may not mark the final bottom of a falling market, it usually signals that a significant low has been seen.

> Price _gaps_ are simply areas on the bar chart where no trading has taken place. In an uptrend, for example, prices open above the highest price of the previous day, leaving a gap or open space on the chart that is not filled during the day. In a downtrend, the day’s highest price is below the previous day’s low. Upside gaps are signs of market strength, while downside gaps are usually signs of weakness. Gaps can appear on long term weekly and monthly charts and, when they do, are usually very significant. But they are more commonly seen on daily bar charts.

## Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques

© 2001 by Steve Nison

### Chapter 1. Introduction

> Year after year the flames of interest grow ever brighter for these charting tools. This is because candle charts:
> 
> - _Are easy to understand_: Anyone, from the first-time chartist to the seasoned professional, can easily harness the power of candle charts. Don’t let the simplicity of these tools fool you. Their power to analyze the health of the market is unmatched by any other charting methodology.
>
> - _Provide earlier indications of market turns_: Candle charts often send out reversal signals well before those of traditional indicators on bar or point and figure charts. This should help you to enter and exit the market with better timing.
>
> - _Furnish unique market insights_: Candle charts not only show the trend of the move, as does a bar chart, but, unlike bar charts, candle charts also show the force underpinning the move.
> 
> - _Are enjoyable to learn_: The picturesque terms such as _dark-cloud covers_, _hammers_, and _windows_ make candle charts fun to use. But don’t let the “picturesque” names fool you. These techniques will be potent weapons in your battle with the markets.
> 
> - _Enhance Western charting analysis_: Candle charts are so versatile, they can be fused with any Western technical tool. For our clients, we merge the insights given by the candle charts with the most potent Western technical analysis tools. If you are a seasoned technician, you will discover how joining Japanese candles with your favorite technical tools can create a powerful synergy of techniques. This merging of Eastern and Western analysis will give you a jump on those who use only traditional Western charting techniques.
> 
> - _Will increase efficiency of your analysis_: Because of the immediate visual information sent out by the candle charts, they will make your market analysis faster and more efficient.
> 
> ...
> 
> Candle charts provide many useful trading signals. They do not, however, provide price targets. This is why it is so important to use Western technical techniques on candle charts.
> 
> ...
> 
> Candles are not designed to be a complete system; they are just one weapon, albeit a powerful one, to use in your trading battles.
> 
> ...
> 
> The importance of technical analysis is multifaceted. First, while fundamental analysis may provide a gauge of the supply/demand situations (i.e., price/earnings ratios, economic statistics) and so forth, there is no psychological component involved in such analysis. Yet the markets are influenced at times, to a major extent, by emotionalism. As John Maynard Keynes stated, “There is nothing so disastrous as a rational investment policy in an irrational world.”? Technical analysis provides the only mechanism to measure the “irrational” (emotional) component present in all markets.
> 
> ...
> 
> Discipline helps mitigate the nemesis of all traders, namely, emotion. As soon as you have money in the market, emotionalism is in the driver’s seat and rationale and objectivity are merely passengers. If you doubt this, try paper trading. Then try trading with your own funds. You will soon discover how deeply the counterproductive aspects of tension, anticipation, and anxiety alter the way you trade and view the markets—usually in proportion to the funds committed. Technicals can put objectivity back into the driver’s seat. They provide a mechanism to set entry and exit points, to set risk/reward ratios, or stop out levels. By using them, you foster a risk and money management approach to trading.
> 
> ...
> 
> Fourth, random walk proffers that the market price for one day has no bearing on the price the following day. But this academic view leaves out an important component—people. People remember prices from one day to the next and act accordingly. To wit, people’s reactions indeed affect price, but price also affects people’s reactions. Thus, price, itself, is an important component in market analysis. Those who disparage technical analysis forget this last point.
> 
> Fifth, the price action is the most direct and easily accessible method of seeing overall supply/demand relationships. There may be fundamental news not known to the general public, but you can expect it is already in the price. Those who have advance knowledge of some market-moving event will most likely buy or sell until current prices reflect their information.

### Chapter 3. Constructing the Candlestick Lines

> ![Bar Chart vs. Candle Chart](/.attachments/bar.chart.vs.candle.chart.png)
> 
> The rectangular sections of the candle lines are called the real body. The real body represents the range between the session’s open and close. When the real body is black (i.e., filled), it means the close of the session was lower than the open. If the real body is white (i.e., empty), it shows the close was higher than the open.
> 
> The thin lines above and below the real body are the shadows (these names are almost lyrical—the real body and the shadows of these real bodies.) These shadows represent the session’s price extremes. The shadow above the real body is called the upper shadow and the shadow below the real body is the lower shadow. Accordingly, the peak of the upper shadow is the high of the session and the bottom of the lower shadow is the low of the session.
> 
> ...
> 
> The Japanese say the real body is “the essence of the price movement.” This reflects a central concept about the power of the real bodies: By looking at the height and color of the real body, we get an immediate visual clue whether it’s the bulls or bears who are in control.

In trading, a candlestick represents the price movement of an asset within a specific timeframe, commonly used in technical analysis. The high and low points of a candlestick provide crucial information:

1. **High:** The topmost point of the vertical line (wick) represents the highest price reached for that asset within the chosen timeframe (e.g., a day, an hour, etc.). It signifies the highest price buyers were willing to pay during that period.

2. **Low:** The bottom of the vertical line (wick) indicates the lowest price reached for the asset within the same timeframe. It reflects the lowest price at which sellers were willing to sell during that period.

The open and close on a candlestick represent the prices at which an asset began and ended within a specific timeframe, such as a day, hour, or minute.

- **Open:** The open price is depicted by the start of the candlestick's body. It signifies the price at which the asset started trading at the beginning of the selected timeframe.

- **Close:** The close price is represented by the end of the candlestick's body. It shows the price at which the asset concluded trading at the end of the selected timeframe.

The color of the candlestick (often green or red) depends on whether the closing price was higher or lower than the opening price:

- **Green/White Candle:** The closing price is higher than the opening price, indicating a net price increase during that timeframe.
  
- **Red/Black Candle:** The closing price is lower than the opening price, signifying a net price decrease during that timeframe.

The body of the candlestick illustrates the price range between the open and close. If the close is higher than the open, the body is typically hollow or filled in, representing an uptrend. Conversely, if the close is lower than the open, the body is usually filled or colored, indicating a downtrend.

Understanding the open and close prices assists traders in gauging market sentiment, price direction, and potential trend reversals.

### Chapter 4. Reversal Patterns

![Candlestick Cheet Sheet](/.attachments/candlestick.cheat.sheet.webp)

> Technicians watch for price clues alerting them to a shift in market psychology and trend. Reversal patterns are these technical clues. Western reversal indicators include double tops and bottoms, reversal days, head and shoulders, and island tops and bottoms. Yet the term “reversal pattern” is somewhat of a misnomer. Hearing that term may lead you to think of an old trend ending abruptly and then reversing to a new trend. This rarely happens. Trend changes usually occur slowly, in stages, as the underlying psychology shifts gears. A trend reversal signal implies that the prior trend is likely to change, but not necessarily reversing. Compare a trend to a car traveling forward. The car’s red brake lights go on and the car stops. The brake light was the reversal indicator showing that the prior trend (that is, the car moving forward) was about to end. But now that the car is stationary, will the driver then decide to put the car in reverse? Will he or she remain stopped? Will he or she decide to go forward again?
> 
> ... 

#### UMBRELLA LINES
 
> Umbrella lines are candles with very long lower shadows and a small real body at the top end of the range. These umbrella lines are fascinating in that these lines can be either bullish or bearish according to the market environment.
> 
> If an umbrella line emerges during a downtrend, it is a signal that the downtrend should end. In such a scenario, this umbrella line is labeled a _hammer_, as in “the market is hammering out” a base. The actual Japanese word for the hammer is takuri. This word means “trying to gauge the depth of the water by feeling for its bottom.” This is a perfect analogy for the hammer line as the market attempts to grope for a bottom. Coincidently, the hammer line looks likes a hammer with its head and handle.
> 
> As mentioned above, the character of umbrella lines changes based on the prevailing trend before the umbrella line. We saw that an umbrella line after a decline is a bullish signal called a hammer. However, if either of the "umbrella" emerges after a rally, it is a potential top reversal signal ominously called _a hanging man_. The name “hanging man” is derived from the fact that it looks like a hanging man with dangling legs.
> 
> ...

> ![Wal-Mart Stores - Daily (Hammer)](/.attachments/wal-mart.stores.daily-hammer.png)

#### THE ENGULFING PATTERN

> ... Most candle signals, ..., are based on combinations of individual candle lines. The engulfing pattern is the first of these multiple candle line patterns. The engulfing pattern is a major reversal signal with two opposite color real bodies composing this pattern.
> 
> ![Bullish Engulfing Pattern](/.attachments/bullish.engulfing.pattern.png)
> 
> _Bullish Engulfing Pattern_
> 
> When a white bullish real body wraps around, or _engulfs_, the prior period's black real body, it is indication of a _bullish engulfing pattern_. Another nickname is a "hugging line" for obvious reasons. This shows buying pressure has overwhelmed selling pressure.
> 
> ![Bearish Engulfing Patter](/.attachments/bearish.engulfing.pattern.png)
> 
> _Bearish Engulfing Pattern_
> 
> When a black real body wraps around, or _engulfs_, the prior period's white real body, it is indication of a _bearish engulfing pattern_. It is the signal of a top reversal. This shows that supply has overwhelmed demand.
> 
> There are three criteria for an engulfing pattern:
>
> 1. The market has to be in a clearly definable uptrend (for a bearish engulfing pattern) or downtrend (for a bullish engulfing pattern), even if the trend is short term.
> 
> 2. Two candles comprise the engulfing pattern. The second real body must engulf the prior real body (it need not engulf the shadows).
> 
> 3. The second real body of the engulfing pattern should be the opposite color of the first real body. (The exception to this rule is if the first real body of the engulfing pattern is a doji. Thus, after an extended fall, a doji engulfed by a very large white real body could be a bottom reversal. In an uptrend, a doji enveloped by a very large black real body could be a bearish reversal pattern).
> 
> ...
> 
> Some factors increasing the likelihood that an engulfing pattern could be an important turning signal are:
> 
> 1. If the first day of the engulfing pattern has a very small real body (i.e., a spinning top) and the second day has a very long real body. The small first real body candle reflects a dissipation of the prior trend’s force and the large second real body proves an increase in force behind the new move.
> 
> 2. If the engulfing pattern appears after a protracted or very fast move. A fast or extended move creates an overextended market (either overbought or oversold) and makes it vulnerable to profit taking.
> 
> 3. If there is heavy volume on the second real body of the engulfing pattern.

#### DARK-CLOUD COVER

> ![Dark Cloud Cover](/.attachments/dark.cloud.cover.png)
> 
> _Dark-Cloud Cover_
> 
> Our next reversal pattern is the _dark-cloud cover_. It is a dual-candle pattern that is a top reversal after an uptrend or, at times, at the top of a congestion band. The first day of this two-candle patter is a strong white real body. The second day's price opens above the prior's session's high (that is, above the top of the upper shadow). However, by the end of the second day's session, the market closes deeply within the prior day's white body. The greater degree of penetration into the white body, the more likely this is a top. Some Japanese technicians require more than a 50-percent penetration of the black session's close into the white real body. If the black candle does not close below the halfway point of the white candlestick, it may be best to wait for more bearish confirmation following the dark-cloud cover. In some circumstances it can be viewed as a dark-cloud cover even if the open is over the prior session's close instead of the prior session's high.
