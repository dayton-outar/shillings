## Introduction to Financial Accounting

© 2014 Charles T. Horngren, Gary L. Sundem, John A. Elliott, Donna R. Philbrick

Important excerpts of key concepts such as financial statement preparation, accrual accounting, transaction analysis, ethical considerations, and financial analysis are highlighted. Also highlighted key points of adhering to accounting standards and ethical guidelines in financial reporting. This provides a solid foundation for understanding and applying the core principles of financial accounting.

### Measuring Income

...

#### The Accounting Time Period

> Established purely for accounting purposes, the fiscal year does not necessarily end on December 31. Many companies choose the end of calendar-year quarters (March 31, June 30, and September 30) as their fiscal year end.

This is an important point to note for data-entry purposes when it comes to the _statement dates_ for annual reports.

#### Revenues and Expenses

> Companies obtain assets by selling products or services and use assets in producing and delivering those products or services. When they sell products or services, they record **revenue** (sometimes called **sales** or **sales revenue** [or **turnover**]), which is the increase in net assets resulting from selling products or services. Revenues increase owners’ equity. In contrast, **expenses** are decreases in net assets as a result of consuming or giving up resources in the process of providing products or services to a customer. Expenses decrease owners’ equity. **Income** (also known as **profits** or **earnings**) is the excess of revenues over expenses. If expenses exceed revenues, we call it a loss.
> 
> ...
> 
> The total cumulative owners’ equity generated by income or profits is called **retained earnings** or **retained income**.

Never seen _sales revenue_ on an income statement. Mostly, _Revenues_, _Sales_ or _Turnover_.

> **Accounts receivable** (sometimes called **trade receivables** or simply receivables) are amounts owed to a company by customers as a result of the company’s delivering goods or services to the customers and extending credit in the ordinary course of business.

These days they seem to be just called _Receivables_.

> ... **cost of goods sold** expense (also called **cost of sales** or **cost of revenue**) is the original acquisition cost of the inventory that a company sells to customers during the reporting period.

#### Accrual vs. Cash

> Under the **accrual basis**, accountants record revenue as it is earned and record expenses as they are incurred, regardless of when cash changes hands. In contrast, the **cash basis** recognizes revenue when a company receives cash and recognizes expenses when it pays cash.

#### Recognition of Revenues

> For revenues to be recognized under U.S. GAAP, it must satisfy the following criteria:
> 
> 1. _They must be earned_. A company earns revenues when it has completed all (or substantially all) that it has promised to a customer. Typically, this involves the delivery of goods or services to a customer. [Take note of this for use of percentage-of-completion (POC) to perform _Earnings Manipulation_]
> 
> 2. _They must be realized or realizable_. Revenues are realized when a company receives cash or claims to cash in exchange for goods or services. A “claim to cash” usually means a customer’s promise to pay. Revenues are realizable when the company receives assets that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash or claims to cash. To recognize revenue on the basis of a promise to pay, the company must be relatively certain that it will receive the cash.
> 
> Revenue recognition for most retail companies, such as Wal-Mart, Safeway, and McDonald’s, is straightforward. Such companies earn and realize revenue at the point of sale&mdash;when a customer makes a full payment by cash, check, or credit card and takes possession of the goods. Other companies may earn and realize revenue at times other than the point of sale.

#### Recognition of Expired Assets

> **depreciation** is the systematic allocation of the acquisition cost of long-lived assets to the expense accounts of the particular accounting periods that benefit from the use of the assets. Depreciation applies to physical assets that a company owns, such as buildings, equipment, furniture, and fixtures, that the company expects to use for multiple periods. (Land is not subject to depreciation because it does not deteriorate over time.)
> 
> ...
>
> In summary, inventory costs are _product costs_ that accountants match to the revenues they help generate. Rent is a _period cost_ that accountants record in the period it benefits. Because equipment benefits many periods, accountants spread its cost over those periods as depreciation expense.

#### Income Statement

> _In summary, inventory costs are product costs that accountants match to the revenues they help generate. Rent is a period cost that accountants record in the period it benefits. Because equipment benefits many periods, accountants spread its cost over those periods as depreciation expense._

Take a look at the balance sheet below.

![Balance Sheet of Biwheels Company](/.attachments/bi-wheel-balance-sheet.png)

Take note of the income statement made from the balance sheet above.

![Income Statement of Biwheels Company](/.attachments/bi-wheel-income-statement.png)

> You can think of income statements as filling in the gaps between balance sheets. The balance sheets show the financial position of the company at discrete points in time, and the income statements explain the changes that have taken place between those points.
>
> ...
>
> One area that requires judgment, and therefore leaves room for ethical conflicts, is depreciation.
>
> ...
>
> the **operating expenses**, which is a group of recurring expenses that pertain to the firm’s routine, ongoing operations. Examples of such expenses are wages, rent, depreciation, and various other operation-oriented expenses, such as telephone, heat, and advertising. We deduct these operating expenses from the gross profit to obtain **operating income** (also called **operating profit** or **income from operations**).
> 
> ...
>
> **gross profit** (also called **gross margin**), ... is the excess of sales revenue over the cost of the inventory that was sold.

#### Statement of Stockholders’ Equity

> The **statement of stockholders’ equity** (or **statement of shareholders’ equity**) shows all changes during the year in each stockholders’ equity account. It starts with the beginning balance in each account, followed by a list of all changes that occurred during the period, followed by the ending balance.
>
> Changes in stockholders’ equity arise from three main sources:
>
> 1. _Net income or net loss_. A period’s net income (net loss) increases (decreases) the balance in the retained earnings portion of stockholders’ equity.
> 2. _Transactions with shareholders_. For many companies, the most common transaction with shareholders is the declaration of dividends, which reduces retained earnings.
> 3. **Other comprehensive income (OCI)**. These are specific changes in stockholders’ equity that do not result from net income or transactions with shareholders. Items classified as other comprehensive income increase or decrease stockholders’ equity but are not recorded as part of paid-in capital or retained earnings. Rather, companies accumulate these items in a stockholders’ equity account entitled **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI)**.
>
> ...
>
> Many companies with negative retained earnings use the more descriptive term **accumulated deficit**.


#### Cash Dividends

> Another decrease in the Retained Earnings account arises from **cash dividends**, distributions of cash to stockholders.
> 
> ...
>
> The board of directors _declares_&mdash;announces its intention to pay&mdash;a dividend on one date (declaration date), payable to those stockholders on _record_ as owning the stock on a second date (record date), and actually _pays_ the dividend on a third date (payment date).

### Accrual Accounting

...

#### Adjustments to the Accounts

> **Explicit transactions** are observable events, such as cash receipts and disbursements, credit purchases, and credit sales that trigger the majority of day-to-day routine journal entries.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Implicit transactions** are events, such as the passage of time, that do not generate source documents or any visible evidence that the event actually occurred. Because there is no specific notification to record such events, accountants do not formally recognize them in the accounting records until the end of an accounting period. For example, accountants prepare entries for depreciation expense or the expiration of prepaid rent from special schedules or memorandums at the end of an accounting period. An explicit event did not trigger such entries. Accountants recorded the related explicit transaction at the time the company purchased the depreciable asset or made the initial rent payment. We call the end-of-period entries that record these implicit events adjustments. **Adjustments** (also called **adjusting entries**) assign the financial effects of implicit transactions to the appropriate time periods. Thus, adjustments occur at periodic intervals, usually at the end of the accounting cycle when accountants are about to prepare the financial statements.
> 
> ...
>
> The principal adjustments arise from four basic types of implicit transactions:
> 1. Expiration or consumption of unexpired costs
>    
>    Biwheels paid $6,000 in January to cover rent for the months of January, February, and March. The company initially recorded$6,000 of Prepaid Rent as an asset. As each day passed, Biwheels incurred rent expense and theasset declined in value. However, there is no benefit to recording daily adjusting entries. Rather,Biwheels made a $2,000 adjustment at the end of each month to reflect the gradual expiration of the rent costs.
>
> 2. Earning of revenues received in advance
>
>    Just as a company acquires assets and recognizes the related expense over time as it uses the assets, it may receive revenue in advance and then earn the revenue over time. **Unearned revenue** (also called **revenue received in advance** or **deferred revenue**) represents cash received from customers who pay in advance for goods or services that the company promises to deliver at a future date. The company receives cash before it earns the related revenue. This commitment to provide goods or services in the future is a liability, and the company must record both the receipt of cash and the liability.
>
> 3. Accrual of unrecorded expenses
>    
>    Wages are an example of a liability that grows moment to moment as employees perform their duties. The services provided by employees represent expenses. It is unnecessary to make hourly, daily, or even weekly formal entries in the accounts for many accrued expenses, as the cost of such frequent recording would exceed the benefits. This is true, even though computers can perform these tasks effortlessly. The costs of computing are small, but in this case the benefits are even smaller. Accountants aggregate these costs only when they prepare financial statements, and this rarely needs to be done hourly or daily. Consequently, they make adjustments to bring each accrued expense (and corresponding liability) account up-to-date at the end of the accounting period, just before they prepare the formal financial statements. These adjustments are necessary to accurately match the expenses to the period in which they help generate revenues.
>
> 4. Accrual of unrecorded revenues
>    
>    Just as the realization of unearned revenues is the mirror image of the expiration of prepaid expenses, the accrual of unrecorded revenues is the mirror image of the accrual of unrecorded expenses. Because the company has not received cash, there is no explicit transaction to trigger a journal entry. However, according to the revenue recognition principle, revenues affect stockholders’ equity in the period a company earns them, not the period in which it receives cash. Thus, an adjustment is required to recognize revenues earned but not yet received.

#### Current Assets and Liabilities

> **Current assets** are cash and other assets that a company expects to convert to cash, sell, or consume during the next 12 months (or within the normal operating cycle if longer than 1 year). Similarly, **current liabilities** are those liabilities that come due within the next year (or within the normal operating cycle if longer than a year).
> 
> ...
>
> The difference between current assets and current liabilities is **working capital** (**net working capital** or **net current assets**).

### Statement of Cash Flows

...

#### Purposes of Cash Flow Statement

> Why do managers and investors use a statement of cash flows?
> 
> 1. It helps them understand the relationship of net income to changes in cash balances. Cash
balances can decline despite positive net income and vice versa.
> 2. It reports past cash flows as an aid to
>    1. predicting future cash flows,
>    2. evaluating how management generates and uses cash, and
>    3. determining a company’s ability to pay interest, dividends, and debts when they are due.
> 3. It identifies specific increases and decreases in a firm’s productive assets.
> 
> ...
>
> **Cash equivalents** are highly liquid short-term investments that a company can easily and quickly convert into cash, such as money market funds and Treasury bills.

#### Typical Activities Affecting Cash

> Operating decisions affect the major day-to-day activities that generate revenues and expenses. The first major section of the statement of cash flows, **cash flows from operating activities** [CFFO], summarizes the cash impact of such decisions.
> ...
>
> **Operating activities** are transactions that affect the purchase, processing, and selling of a company’s products and services. For example, making sales, collecting accounts receivable, recording an expense for cost of goods sold, purchasing inventory, and paying accounts payable or employee wages are all operating activities. The thing these transactions have in common is that they are an integral part of the major income-generating activities of the company.
> 
> ...
>
> Managers make financing decisions when they decide whether and how to raise or repay cash. For example, when a company needs cash, financial managers may decide whether to borrow money from a bank or other lender or issue additional capital stock. When there is excess cash, financial managers may decide to repay previous borrowings or to buy back previously issued stock. To understand financing decisions, we use the section of the statement of cash flows labeled **cash flows from financing activities**. **Financing activities** are a company’s transactions that obtain resources by borrowing from creditors or selling shares of stock and use resources to repay creditors or provide a return to shareholders.
> 
> ...
>
> After raising capital, managers must decide how to invest the capital. These investing decisions include the choices to (1) acquire or dispose of plant, property, equipment, and other long-term productive assets, and (2) provide or collect cash as a lender or as an owner of securities. The statement of cash flows covers the results of investing decisions in a section labeled **cash flows from investing activities**. **Investing activities** are transactions that acquire or dispose of long-lived assets or acquire or dispose of securities held for investment purposes that are not cash equivalents. Thus, purchasing property or equipment is an investing activity, but purchasing inventory or prepaying rent are operating activities. Why? Because a company will generally use property and equipment for multiple years, whereas it will use inventory and prepaid rent within one year.

![Typical Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities](/.attachments/cash-flow-sections-structure.png)

> _There is one more item you will see on the cash flow statements of companies with international operations—the effect of exchange rates on cash. Companies show this effect after the operating, investing, and financing activities. The effect of exchange rates is not a cash flow, but it appears on the cash flow statement because it is necessary for the reconciliation of cash balances at the beginning and end of the period._

#### Cash Flows from Investing Activities

![Analysis of Effects of Financing and Investing Transactions on Cash](/.attachments/analysis-effects-financing-investing.png)

> ... selling investment securities (except for securities that are cash equivalents) increases cash (+) and making a loan decreases cash (–). Notice that buying or selling securities that are cash equivalents does not change cash. It simply turns one type of cash into another type of cash.

### Approaches to Calculating the Cash Flows from Operating Activities

> Under current U.S. GAAP, companies can use either of two approaches to compute cash flows from operating activities (or cash flows from operations). The **direct method** subtracts operating cash disbursements from operating cash collections to arrive at net cash flow from operations. The **indirect method** starts with the accrual net income from the income statement and adjusts it to reflect only those income statement activities that involve actual cash receipts and cash disbursements. Both methods produce the same amount of net cash provided by (or used for) operating activities. The only difference is the format of the operating section of the cash flow statement.

![Analysis of Effects of Operating Transactions on Cash](/.attachments/analysis-effects-operations.png)

> These cash flows are associated with revenues and expenses on the income statement. Notice that recording revenue from the sales of goods or services does not necessarily increase cash. Only sales for cash immediately increase cash. There is no cash effect of credit sales until the customer actually pays. Biwheels must collect its accounts receivable to generate any cash. Similarly, cash received for services to be performed in the future is an operating cash inflow recognized in the statement of cash flows even though a company may not earn and record the revenue until a later period.
> 
> ...
>
> **ADJUSTMENT FOR DEPRECIATION** The first adjustment is to add depreciation expense back to net income. We do this because we deducted depreciation of $100 when computing the net income of $57,900, but there is no related operating cash outflow in January. In fact, depreciation never entails an operating cash flow because the cash flow occurred as an investing activity when Biwheels paid for the equipment. Because we deducted $100 of depreciation in computing January’s net income, adding it back simply cancels the deduction. There is no cash flow effect of depreciation. A word of caution—do not interpret the $100 depreciation add-back as a cash inflow. While line items in the financing and investing sections of a statement of cash flows represent cash inflows and cash outflows, the line items in the operating section of an indirect method statement are not cash flows. Rather, they are adjustments of net income. An adjustment similar to the one made for depreciation will apply to any expense for which there is never an operating cash outflow.
> 
> ...
>
> **ADJUSTMENT FOR REVENUES** Consider Biwheels’ revenues. If all of Biwheels’ sales were for cash, there would be no accounts receivable, the associated cash flows would occur at the time of sale, and the cash inflow would equal the sales revenue. However, Biwheels’ January sales are all on open account. Thus, each sale initially increases accounts receivable, and the cash inflow occurs when Biwheels collects the receivable from the customer. You can compute the amount of cash collections from income statement and balance sheet data in two steps: (1) compute the total amount Biwheels could possibly collect in the month, which is the sales for the month plus the accounts receivable balance at the beginning of the month, and (2) from this you subtract the amount that Biwheels has not yet collected, the accounts receivable at the end of the month.
> 
> ...
>
> **ADJUSTMENT FOR COST OF GOODS SOLD** Just as we adjusted sales to compute cash collections from customers, we can adjust cost of goods sold to compute cash outflow for payments to suppliers. To do this, we use one income statement account, Cost of Goods Sold, and two balance sheet accounts, Inventory and Accounts Payable.
> 
> ...
>
> **ADJUSTMENTS FOR OTHER EXPENSES** ... a general approach to adjustments
>
> - Adjust for revenues and expenses that do not require cash:
>
>   - Add back depreciation.
>   - Add back other expenses that do not require cash.
>   - Deduct revenues that do not generate cash.

> - Adjust for changes in noncash assets and liabilities relating to operating activities:
>   
>   - Add decreases in operating assets.
>   - Deduct increases in operating assets.
>   - Add increases in operating liabilities.
>   - Deduct decreases in operating liabilities.

#### The Statement of Cash Flows and the Balance Sheet Equation

> The balance sheet equation provides the conceptual basis for all financial statements, including the statement of cash flows.
>
> $$\large \text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Stockholders' equity}$$
> 
> $$\large \text{Cash} + \text{Noncash assets (NCA)} = \text{L} + \text{SE}$$
> 
> $$\large \Delta\text{Cash} = \Delta \text{L} + \Delta \text{SE} - \Delta \text{NCA}$$
> 
> Therefore:

### Long-lived Assets

> Long-lived assets can be either tangible or intangible. **Tangible assets** (also called **fixed assets**) are physical items that you can see and touch. Examples are land, buildings, and equipment. In contrast, **intangible assets** lack physical substance. They generally consist of contractual rights, legal rights, or economic benefits. Examples are patents, trademarks, and copyrights. Financial instruments such as accounts receivable, notes receivable, and investments in bonds and stocks also lack physical substance, but these assets are not classified as intangibles for accounting purposes. Accounts and notes receivable represent claims to cash and are accounted for ... Investments in bonds and stocks aren’t classified as intangible assets because they are not part of the operating activities of the company.
> 
> ...
>
> For tangible assets such as buildings, machinery, and equipment, they call it _depreciation_. They use **amortization** to refer to the allocation of the costs of intangible assets to the periods that benefit from these assets. Finally, for natural resources, they call it **depletion**.

#### Contrasting Long-lived Asset Expenditures with Expenses

> companies make expenditures to purchase assets. For those assets to remain on the balance sheet they must continue to provide future economic benefits to the company and be reliably measured. Companies use the benefits provided by some assets, such as advertising services, almost immediately, so they record such expenditures directly as expenses. Companies use the benefits of other assets, such as prepaid rent, within a year, so the expenditures are classified as current assets for a short period before companies recognize them as expenses. Finally, companies **capitalize** assets that have benefits lasting more than a year; that is, they record the purchase price in a long-term asset account and recognize part of the purchase price as an expense each period as they use the asset. Capital expenditures result in new long-lived assets, or they increase the capacity, efficiency, or useful life of existing long-lived assets.
> 
> Sometimes it is difficult to decide whether to capitalize or expense a particular expenditure. Consider the expenditure for work performed on an engine. The company should capitalize this expenditure only if it increases the capacity, efficiency, or useful life of the engine beyond initial expectations. If it merely keeps the engine running as expected, it is an expense. In the absence of contradictory evidence, most accountants would call it an expense. Why? Because accountants and auditors watch for tendencies to understate current expenses, thereby overstating income, through the unjustified capitalization of expenditures that should be expensed.
> 
> ...
>
> The **fair value** of an asset is the price for which a company could sell the asset to an independent third party. When a stock trades actively, we typically assume that the fair value of the stock is the best indicator of the value of the transaction. After all, if we asked four different appraisers to appraise the land, they would probably arrive at four different values, while the stock exchange determines a value for shares of stock at any given point in time.

#### Depreciation of Buildings and Equipment

> The cost a company allocates as depreciation over the total useful life of the asset is the **depreciable value** (also **depreciable base** or **allocation base**). It is the difference between the total acquisition cost and the estimated residual value. The **residual value**, also known as **terminal value**, **disposal value**, **salvage value**, and **scrap value**, is the amount a company expects to receive from sale or disposal of a long-lived asset at the end of its useful life. The **useful life** or **service life** of an asset is the shorter of the physical life of the asset or the economic life of the asset. The economic life of an asset and its physical life need not be the same. The physical life of an asset depends on the wear and tear it takes while in use.
> 
> ...
>
> Depreciation methods differ primarily in the amount of cost allocated to each accounting period. A list of depreciation amounts for each period of an asset’s useful life is a **depreciation schedule**.

#### Impairment of Assets

> Downward revaluations due to impairment occur under both U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Both U.S. GAAP and IFRS require that, at each reporting date, companies assess whether impairment indicators exist for long-lived assets. Companies must review assets for impairment whenever indicators suggest that impairment is possible. Indicators that may lead to a review for impairment include, but are not limited to, _a significant decline in the market price of an asset, a significant change in the manner in which an asset is being used, an adverse change in legal or business environment, evidence of obsolescence or physical damage, or a forecast indicating that the company will experience continuing losses associated with the use of the asset_.
>
> Suppose that Intel, a company reporting under U.S. GAAP, owns equipment with a net book value of $150,000. Due to a change in technology and product demand, Intel determines that it must review the asset for impairment. U.S. GAAP requires a two-step process. The first step in the impairment review is a **recoverability test** that compares the sum of the expected future net cash flows from the use of the asset plus its expected future disposal value with the current carrying value of the asset. If the sum of the estimated cash flows plus disposal value is greater than the carrying value, the asset is not impaired. If the sum of the estimated cash flows plus disposal value is less than the carrying value, Intel must consider the asset to be impaired. Suppose Intel estimates the total expected future net cash flows to be $127,000. Because this is less than the carrying value of $150,000, there is evidence of impairment. Thus Intel proceeds to the second step, computation of the dollar amount of the impairment loss.
> 
> The impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. If there is an active market for the asset being evaluated, the fair value is the current market price. In the absence of an active market, Intel must estimate the fair value using appropriate valuation techniques. One such valuation technique estimates the fair value of an asset as the _present value_ of the expected future net cash flows generated by the asset. ... Under this valuation technique it would use the present value of those expected future net cash flows to calculate the magnitude of the loss. Assume that the market price (fair value) of the equipment in our example is known and is $105,000. Therefore, Intel must record an impairment loss of $45,000.

#### Intangible Assets

> In recent years we have seen an increase in the number of firms in the economy that are “knowledge-based” businesses. The value of these firms lies in intangibles such as internal research and development activities and intellectual capital. However, under existing U.S. GAAP, if a company does not acquire these resources externally, it cannot record them as assets. Some analysts believe that R&D and perhaps other expenditures for intellectual capital should be capitalized, and they adjust the financial statements accordingly
> 
> ...
>
> **Patents** are grants made by the federal government to the inventor of a product or process, bestowing (in the United States) the exclusive right to produce and sell a given product, or use a process, for up to 20 years. After that time, others can manufacture the product or use the process. Suppose a company acquires a newly patented product from an inventor for $170,000. Although the remaining legal life of this patent is 20 years, because of fast-changing technology, the economic life of the patent is only 5 years. The company would amortize the asset over 5 years, the shorter of the economic or legal life, making the annual amortization expense ($170,000 ÷ 5) = $34,000.
> 
> ...
>
> **Copyrights** are exclusive rights to reproduce and sell a book, musical composition, film, or similar creative item. In the United States, the federal government issues these rights and provides protection to a company or individual for the life of the creator plus 70 years. The initial costs of obtaining copyrights from the government are nominal; however, a company may
pay a large sum to purchase an existing copyright from the owner. For example, a publisher of paperback books will sometimes pay the author of a popular novel in excess of $1 million for the writer’s copyright. Although copyrights have a long legal life, their economic lives are frequently significantly shorter.
> 
> ...
>
> **Trademarks** are distinctive identifications of a manufactured product or of a service, taking the form of a name, a sign, a slogan, a logo, or an emblem. Well-known examples include the distinctive cursive script logo for Coca-Cola, the McDonald’s Golden Arches and the Nike Swoosh logo. Trademarks, trade names, trade brands, secret formulas, and similar items are property rights with economic lives that depend on their estimated length of use. If you look at Coca-Cola’s balance sheet, you see no accounting recognition of its secret formula. The company did not purchase the formula, rather it was developed internally. As a result, Coca-Cola did not record an asset. In fact, the story is that Coca-Cola chose to keep the formula a secret instead of patenting it because it did not want the patent protection to expire, leaving others free to produce the product. The Coca-Cola balance sheet also does not report an intangible asset for the Coca-Cola trademark, although Coke has spent millions of advertising dollars creating public awareness of the brand and millions more dollars protecting it from infringement. Coca-Cola’s balance sheet does show an account entitled Trademarks. What does this account represent? Coca-Cola acquired the trademarks of such companies as _Fanta_ and _Minute-Maid_, so it lists them as intangible assets. Similarly, PepsiCo includes a trademark value for _Gatorade_ among its intangible assets because it purchased the trademark rights when it bought Quaker Oats Company.
> 
> ...
>
> **Franchises** and **licenses** are legal contracts that grant the buyer the right to sell a product or service in accordance with specified conditions. An example is a local Starbucks franchise. The buyer obtains the right to use the Starbucks name, to acquire branded products such as cups, and to share in advertising and special promotions. In exchange, the franchisee promises to follow Starbucks procedures and maintain standards of quality, cleanliness, and pricing. Other private sector companies may award franchises for car dealerships, fast-food restaurants, hotel operations, or gasoline stations. These types of franchise agreements typically have a finite life. While the terms of franchise agreements can differ significantly, most often franchisees capitalize the up-front franchise fee and amortize that fee over the life of the franchise agreement.
> 
> ...
>
> A **leasehold** is the right to use a fixed asset (such as a building or some portion thereof) for a specified period of time beyond 1 year. Companies often classify leaseholds with plant assets on the balance sheet, although they are technically intangible assets. A company that owns its own plant clearly counts that plant as a tangible asset. However, if a company leases the plant, then it owns only the right to use the leased plant, not the plant itself.
> 
> ... a **leasehold improvement**, which occurs when a tenant spends money to add new materials or improvements to a leased property. These improvements become part of the leased property and revert to the landlord at the end of the lease.

#### Goodwill

> Goodwill is an intangible asset that cannot be separated from the company that owns it and therefore it cannot be sold or transferred. A company can recognize **goodwill** only when it buys another company. Goodwill is the excess of the amount paid for the acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets.

Investopedia defines _goodwill_ as follows[^2],

> Specifically, a goodwill definition is the portion of the purchase price that is higher than the sum of the net fair value of all of the assets purchased in the acquisition and the liabilities assumed in the process.
>
> The value of a company’s name, brand reputation, loyal customer base, solid customer service, good employee relations, and proprietary technology represent aspects of goodwill. This value is why one company may pay a premium for another.

> Companies do not amortize goodwill. However, they must review goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances suggest the possibility of impairment.

#### Depletion of Natural Resources

> Our final group of long-lived assets is natural resources (sometimes called wasting assets), such as minerals, oil, and timber. Depletion is the accounting mechanism used to allocate the acquisition cost of natural resources over time. Depletion differs from depreciation because depletion focuses specifically on the physical use and exhaustion of the natural resources, whereas depre ciation focuses more broadly on any reduction of the economic value of a fixed asset, including physical deterioration and obsolescence.
>
> Accountants usually classify the costs of natural resources as noncurrent assets. However, buying natural resources is actually like buying massive quantities of inventories under the ground (iron ore) or above the ground (timber). Depletion expense is the measure of the portion of this “long-term inventory” that a company uses up in a particular period. For example, a coal mine may have a total cost of $20 million and originally contain an estimated 1 million tons of usable coal. The depletion rate would be ($20 million ÷ 1 million tons) = $20 per ton. If the company mined 100,000 tons during the first year, the depletion expense would be (100,000 tons × $20), or $2 million for that year. Each year the company would measure the amount of coal extracted and record the amount of depletion based on that usage.
>
> As our coal mine example shows, companies measure depletion on a units-of-production basis. They may directly reduce the asset account, or they may accumulate depletion in a separate contra account similar to accumulated depreciation. Environmental laws and ethical responsibility often lead a firm to expend substantial amounts to return the site to a safe and attractive condition after exhausting the natural resources. When calculating the depletion per unit, companies add these expected future costs when computing the total costs subject to depletion. Therefore, the depletion per unit includes not only the original cost of the resources but also future restoration costs. The companies add the portion of depletion that represents future costs for site restoration to an Asset Retirement Liability account that grows as extraction continues.

### Liabilities and Interest

> ... **long-term liabilities** are those that fall due more than 1 year after the balance sheet date.

Bonds, leases and pensions are usually classified as long-term liabilities.

### Stockholder's Equity

> The articles of incorporation referenced earlier establish the maximum number of shares of stock a company can legally issue. We call these **authorized shares**. When the company receives cash or other consideration in exchange for authorized stock certificates, the shares become **issued shares**. We call shares that are issued and held by the stockholders **outstanding shares**. Often the articles of incorporation specify the process whereby the shareholders can authorize additional shares in the future.
> 
> ...
>
> Sometimes a company buys back shares of stock from its own shareholders. It might buy them to reduce shareholder claims permanently. Alternatively, companies may hold the shares for later use, usually to distribute as part of employee bonuses or stock purchase plans. We call such temporarily held shares **treasury stock**. Treasury shares are considered issued, but because the company holds them, they are no longer considered outstanding.
> 
> ...
>
> **Preferred stock** offers the stockholder different rights and preferential treatment relative to common stockholders. The terms of preferred stock can include almost any arrangement the company and stockholders agree upon. For example, preferred stockholders often surrender the right to vote. In exchange, they usually have a right to dividends before common shareholders can receive a dividend.
> 
> ...
>
> In addition to the cumulative dividend feature, preferred stock usually has a specific **liquidating value**&mdash;the amount a company needs to pay to all preferred stockholders, in addition to any dividends in arrears, before it distributes any assets to common stockholders if the company is liquidated. The stock certificate generally states the exact liquidating value, which is often the same as par value. Because par value often defines the liquidating value and may define the amount of the dividend, it is economically important for preferred stock.
> 
> ...
>
> **Stock options** give the holder the right to purchase a specific number of shares of a corporation’s capital stock at a predetermined price, known as the exercise price or strike price, for a specific time period. Companies often give options to employees as part of their compensation. The company typically gives (or grants) the options to an employee with the provision that the employee must remain with the company for a period of time before being allowed to exercise the options, at which point the options become vested options—options that the holders have the power to exercise. Once vested, the employee may exercise the options anytime before they expire, usually for another 5 years or so. Stock options are especially valuable to executives and other employees because they can gain the benefits of stock price increases without bearing the risks of price declines. Shareholders can also benefit from stock options because they motivate employees to work hard and to make decisions that increase the value of their shares.
> 
> ...
>
> Many companies use restricted stock plans instead of stock option plans to motivate their employees. Granting **restricted stock** is like paying employees with common stock instead of cash. Restricted stock typically has constraints that prohibit employees from selling the stock until it vests and require employees to forfeit the stock if they leave the company prior to the end of the vesting period. Some firms also require that the stock be sold back to the issuing company if the employee decides to sell. Similar to the accounting for a stock option plan, a restricted stock plan requires a company to record a salary and wage expense over the vesting period in an amount equal to the value of the stock awarded. Each period the expense is offset by an increase to paid-in capital. Employees receive an asset that will increase and decrease in value exactly in proportion to the increases and decreases in value experienced by shareholders. In addition, employees holding restricted stock receive the same dividends that common stockholders receive.
> 
> ...
>
> A **stock split** refers to the distribution of additional shares to existing stockholders without any additional consideration provided by the stockholders to the firm. Issuance of one additional share for each share currently owned is a “two-for-one” split. For example, suppose the Allstar Equipment Company has 100,000 shares outstanding with a market value of $150 per share and par value of $10 per share. The total market value of the stock is thus $15 million. Suppose Allstar Equipment gives each shareholder an additional share for each share owned. The total number of shares would increase to 200,000. If nothing else about the company changes (assets, liabilities, and equity all stay the same), the total market value of the outstanding stock should still be $15 million. With 200,000 shares outstanding, though, the market value per share should drop to $75. Shareholders are as well-off as they were before because they have paid no additional money and they still have the same proportional ownership interest in the company.
> 
> ...
>
> **Stock dividends** are also distributions of additional shares to existing shareholders without additional consideration provided by the stockholder. However, the relative number of new shares issued is usually smaller than in a split, although this is not a requirement. More importantly, a stock dividend increases the number of shares but does not change the per share par value. Consequently, the total par value of common stock reported on the balance sheet increases.

#### Retained Earnings Restrictions

> The most closely watched part of stockholders’ equity, both by shareholders and creditors, is retained earnings. Boards of directors can make decisions that benefit shareholders but hurt creditors. For example, directors might pay excessive dividends that jeopardize payments of creditors’ claims. To protect creditors, state laws or contractual obligations often restrict dividend-declaring power. For example, authorities in some jurisdictions do not permit boards to declare dividends if those dividends would cause stockholders’ equity to be less than total paid-in capital. Therefore, retained earnings must exceed the cost of treasury stock. If there is no treasury stock, retained earnings must be positive. This restriction limits payments and thus protects the position of the creditors. Furthermore, many lenders require debt covenants that restrict certain uses of cash, such as dividend payments.
>
> To reflect these limitations, management may designate a portion of retained earnings as being unavailable for dividends or otherwise restricted. Most companies with restrictions of retained earnings disclose them in the footnotes. Occasionally, restrictions appear as a line item on the balance sheet called **restricted retained earnings** or **appropriated retained earnings**&mdash;a part of retained earnings that companies cannot reduce by dividend declarations. In Europe, companies often use the term reserves to refer to restricted retained earnings. Accountants use the term **reserve** in many ways, but we will use it to mean only one thing: restrictions of dividend declarations. In the United States, reserves are not common. When they exist, they generally represent a statement by the board of directors of its intent to restrict dividend payments to retain cash for a particular purpose such as a plant expansion. In many countries, laws further restrict the payment of dividends, resulting in a shareholders’ equity line called legal reserves.

#### Capital and Reserves

Issued share capital is the total amount of shares that have been given to shareholders.

> To raise finance, a company can issue different types of shares ... Only ordinary share capital confers the rights of ownership in the company. Ordinary shareholders are ‘equity’ owners in the business.
> 
> When a company issues ordinary shares in exchange for consideration (typically cash), the sums are recorded as **share capital** and cannot be paid back to shareholders except by court approval, e.g. on liquidation of a business.
>
> _Individual_ shareholders can sell shares, e.g. through a stock exchange (for listed companies) or to a private buyer. From a _company_ perspective, however, this has no effect on the capital invested in the company as shareholders are re-selling shares previously issued by the company.
> 
> **Reserves** belong to shareholders and are classified as _revenue_ or _capital_. The distinction determines whether or not the reserve is distributable, i.e. can be paid out to shareholders as dividends. Revenue reserves are distributable and are created by a company’s trading and operating activities. Profits can be distributed as dividends to shareholders. Any profits not distributed accumulate in a ‘retained earnings’ reserve available for future distribution.
> 
> In contrast, capital reserves are not distributable. They exist to protect creditors.
> 
> A company’s ‘capital and reserves’ balance is an indicator of its financial strength ...
> 
> A company planning to pay dividends to its shareholders can only do so from its revenue reserves. It cannot legally pay a dividend if the payment would have the effect of reducing its net assets to below its _capital_ reserves (plus share capital) balance. These regulations are known as _capital maintenance rules_ and prevent shareholders extracting too much cash from the company.
>
> Creditors have priority in a winding up and capital maintenance rules help give ‘substance’ to this prioritisation, i.e. there would be no point in creditors having priority over shareholders on a winding up if there were no restrictions on a company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders ...
> 
> While legal protection exists, it is important for creditors and lenders to note that capital reserves may nevertheless be depleted where a company is making losses.
>
> **Capital reserves** are created in a variety of ways:
> 1. Shareholder contributions
>
>    The share premium reserve is created when shares are issued by a company at a price in excess of the nominal value of shares. The share premium reserve is a non-distributable legal reserve and an example of what is known as a ‘capital reserve’.
>
> 2. Statute
>
>    Companies may be required to maintain certain types of reserves by legislation. For example there is a requirement to create a _capital redemption reserve_ consisting of the nominal value of shares repurchased and cancelled by a company. This reserve maintains capital in the business providing protection for creditors.
>
> 3. Accounting requirements
>
>    Most other reserves result from accounting requirements and reflect measurement changes in equity rather than profit and loss. Some common examples are given below.
>    1. _Revaluation reserve_. Fixed assets may be revalued to fair value. A revaluation surplus is a capital reserve and therefore cannot be distributed, although a surplus may be transferred periodically to the profit and loss reserve and distributed as a dividend. The amount that can be transferred is based on the difference between depreciation on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and depreciation based on the asset’s original cost. When a revalued asset is sold, any balance in the reserve (relating to the asset sold) may be transferred to retained earnings and distributed as a dividend.
>    2. _Foreign currency translation reserve_. Foreign currency differences arising from converting (‘translating’) assets, liabilities, income and expenses from an entity’s functional currency to the reporting currency result in a foreign currency reserve. The reserve arises only in group situations in consolidated accounts. It is only on disposal of a foreign entity that any accumulated translation differences can be recognised as part of the profit on sale of the entity.

### Intercorporate Investments and Consolidations

...

#### Consolidated Financial Statements

> Why have subsidiaries? Why not integrate the smaller companies into the larger parent to create a single legal entity? The reasons include limiting the liabilities in a risky venture, saving income taxes, conforming to government regulations with respect to a part of the business, doing business in a foreign country, and expanding in an orderly way while retaining the ability to subsequently sell or spin off the separate corporate subsidiary. For example, there are often tax advantages for the sellers when an acquisition involves selling the capital stock of a going concern instead of its individual assets. Sometimes foreign subsidiaries face more favorable treatment from their country of residence than a foreign parent corporation would experience.

#### Noncontrolling Interests

> ... Coca-Cola owns more than 50% but less than 100% of many companies. Coca-Cola consolidates each company into its consolidated financial statements but recognizes the claim on some of the consolidated assets held by other owners. These claims are called noncontrolling interests. **Noncontrolling interests** represent the claims of nonmajority shareholders in the assets and earnings of a company whose accounts are consolidated into the accounts of the majority shareholder. On its consolidated 2011 earnings statement, Coca-Cola shows a reduction of net income of $62 million due to noncontrolling interests. On the consolidated balance sheet, Coca-Cola shows $286 million of noncontrolling interests. Note that the labels are identical: noncontrolling interests. Thus, it is up to you, the reader, to know that the $62 million on the income statement is the current year increase, whereas the $286 million on the balance sheet is the cumulative effect.

## Warren Buffet's Interpretation of Financial Statements

![Warren Buffet and the Interpretation of Financial Statements](/.attachments/warren.buffet.interpretation.jpg)

© 2008 by David Clark and Mary Buffett

...

### Income Statements

1. Gross Profit Margin
    > margins _[consistently]_ below 20% is a good indicator of a fiercely competitive market
2. Depreciation against Gross Profits (dividing Depreciation by Gross Profit)
    > companies with a percentage depreciation lower than 8% tend to have a durable competitive advantage
3. Earnings per Stock Unit
    > a consistent upward trend is a good sign

### Balance Sheet

1. Quick Ratio
    > companies with surplus of cash have a durable competitive advantage
2. Inventory Turnover
    > manufacturing companies with inventories that ramp up stock in one year and ramp down the next year is showing signs of being in a highly competitive market
3. Receivables Turnover
    > companies consistently showing lower ratio of recievables compared to their competitors has a higher competitive advantage
4. Return on Assets
    > high ROA may indicate vulnerability of the company and, hence, vulnerability of durable competitive advantage
5. Total Assets
    > high total asset can present high barrier to entry [for other prospective competitors to enter]
6. Long-term vs Short-term Debt
    > Buffet shied away from companies that are bigger borrowers of short-term money [rather] than long-term money. He preferred Wells-Fargo $0.57 of short-term debt to every dollar or long-term debt than to Bank of America $2.09 of short-term debt to every dollar of long-term debt.
7. Debt-to-Equity
    > companies with durable competitive advantage often carry little or no long-term debt
    > sometimes this can be skewed to make a great company look mediocre ***due to stock buybacks***
8. Return on Equity
    > high ROE will add up and increase the underlying value of the company

### Cash Flow

1. Treasury Stock Units
    > presence of treasury shares is a hallmark of a company with durable competitive advantage
2. Preferred Stock Units
    > companies with durable competitive advantage tend not have preferred shares


## Financial Reporting Shenanigans

![Financial Shenanigans](/.attachments/financial.shenanigans.jpg)

© 2018 by Howard M. Schilit, Jeremy Perler, Yoni Engelhart

These are the classification of shenanigans that can be undertaken by companies when they report their stewardship of the company.


### Earnings Manipulation

1. Recording revenue too soon
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Recording revenue before completing material obligations under the contract

      > ... pushed customers to sign contracts just before quarter-end, believing that the signing of a contract was the key event to permit recording revenue.
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > ... revenues should be recognized when earned, not at the point of signing a contract
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > ... the company began to recognize some revenue earlier in the sales process &mdash; at the point of shipment, rather than delivery.

   2. Recording revenue far in excess of work completed on the contract
      
      > ... [recording] revenue in a far greater amount than is warranted
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > Specifically, Ulvac [a company] had just changed its revenue recognition approach to percentage-of-completion (POC), and as a result, it began booking sales much earlier than it would with its traditional approach. ... Ulvac provides an illustration of the dramatic jump in reported revenue when a company switches from standard revenue recognition practices to the more aggressive POC approach.
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > Investors should be extra vigilant when _analyzing_ companies using percentage-of-completion accounting, since the reported results hinge on the company's estimates about its own progress.
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > Investors shold use a measure called "days' sales outstanding" (DSO)[^3] to evaluate how quickly customers are paying their bills relative to how quickly revenue is recorded. A higher DSO could indicate more aggressive revenue recognition in addition to simply poor cash management.

      We could say that ***recording revenue before completing material obligations*** and ***recording revenue far in excess of work completed*** are generally the same thing but the subtle difference is that this technique (_recording in excess of work completed_) is legitimized through a POC policy. Basically both techniques involves recognizing revenue before completion of delivery of the product or service offered by the company (or business).

   3. Recording revenue before the buyer's final acceptance of the product

   4. Recording revenue when the buyer's payment remains uncertain or unnecessary

2. Recording bogus revenue
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Recording revenue from transactions that lack economic substance
      
      > In these transactions, the so-called customer is either under no obligation to keep or pay for the product, or no product or service was even traferred in the first place.
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > Brightpoint proceeded to record the $15 million "insurance recovery" as income in the December quarter (which netted out its unreported losses). AIG recorded what amounted to bogus revenue on the insurance premiums over the next three years. Economic sense dictates that this transaction was not an insurance contract because no real risk had been transferred. Indeed, the transaction was nothing more than a financing arrangement: Brightpoint deposited cash at AIG, which AIG eventually refunded as purported "insurance claim payments."
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > As we have learned, ***a rapid increase in accounts receivable is often an indication of deteriorating financial health***
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > .... [a company] not only sold products to a distributor but later repurchased from that same distributor unwanted, unused, or overpriced products, initiating a "round-trip" cash payment that would come back to Autonomy [another company]. According to the SEC, this scheme alon inflated Autonomy's reported revenue by nearly $200 million between 2009 and 2011.

   2. Recording revenue from transactions that lack a resonable arm's-length process
      
      > ... staggering revenue growth came from a 10-fold increase in sales to a suspicious related party. The sales accounted for nearly half of Syntax-Billian's total revenue, and the related party was an Asian distributor named South China House of Technology (SCHOT). Syntax-Brillian's relationship with SCHOT was much more incestuous than a typical customer-supplier arragement. The two companies seemed to be involved in a tangled web of joint ventures (which also, oddly, included Syntax-Brillian's primary supplier). Syntax-Brillian was close enough with SCHOT that it granted it 120-day payment terms and routinely extended those terms even further. .... Then suddenly, in February 2008, Syntax-Brillian cryptically announced that the Olympic facilities would no longer be installing the TVs that the company had "sold" to South China House of Technology. Even though Syntax-Brillian had already recorded revenue from the sale of these TVs, it agreed to "repurchase" more than 25,000 TVs for nearly $100 million. The company did not need to come up with the cash because the receivable from SCHOT was, of course, still outstanding. With this significant right or return and no receipt of cash, Syntax-Brillian should never have recognized this revenue in the first place!

   3. Recording revenue on receipts from non-revenue-producing transactions
      
      > Apparently, auto parts manufacturer Delphi Corporation failed to understand the distinction between a liability and revenue. In late December 2000, Delphi took out a $200 million short-term loan, posting inventory as collateral. Rather than recording the cash received as a liability that needed to be paid back, Delphi improperly recorded it as the sale of goods &mdash; as if the inventory posted as collateral had been purchased by the bank.
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > When purchasing goods from a vendor, cash normally flows in one direction &mdash; from the customer to the vendor. Sometimes, cash will flow in the opposite direction, usually in the form of a volume rebate or refund. Booking these cash rebates as revenue would clearly be inappropriate, as they should be considered an adjustment to the cost of inventory purchased. However, the creative folks at Sunbeam did not see it that way. Sunbeam played a neat trick to boost revenue in which it advanced cash to vendors and then recorded revenue when that cash was repaid. Additionally, Sunbeam would commit to future purchases from a particular vendor in exchange for an immediate "rebate" from that vendor, which Sunbeam, or course, recorded as revenue.

  4. Recording revenue from inappropriate transactions, but at inflated amounts

     > ... by booking as sales the gross amount its members paid for a deal, without deducting the sizable portion it owed to the merchants. In the restated registration documents, the SEC mandated that Groupon change from the "gross" to "net" method, causing revenue to melt down from almost $1.6 billion to only $688 million, a decline of 57 percent during the six months ended June 2011.

3. Boosting income using one-time or unsustainable activities
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Boosting income using one-time events

      > ... IBM booked a $4.1 billion gain from selling its Global Network business to AT&T and curiously included that gain as a _reduction in the SG&A [Selling, general and administrative] expense._

   2. Boosting income through misleading classifications
      
      > While treating interest income as revenue clearly would be appropriate for banks and other financial institutions, it certainly sounds a bit unusual for a restaurant.
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > Companies can produce misleadingly strong revenue and operating income growth simply by benefiting from one of the quirks of consolidation accounting. Let's look at the accounting if a company decided to form several majority-owned joint ventures, owning 60 percent of each. Accounting rules require that the units be consolidated and that the "parent" report all the revenue and operating expenses as operating income (that is, above the line) as if were its own; the 40 percent owned by others would be subtracted later on the Income Statement (below the line).

4. Shifting current expenses to a later period
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Excessively capitalizing normal operating expenses

      > ... improperly [recording] costs on the Balance Sheet as an asset (or "capitalizing" the costs), instead of expensing them immediately.
        ... assets [fall] into two categories: (1) those that are expected to produce a future benefit (e.g. inventory, equipment, and prepaid insurance) and (2) those that are ultimately expected to be exchanged for another asset such as cash (e.g., receivables and investments).
      > ...
      > 
      > **Warning Signs of Improperly Capitalizing Normal Operating Expenses**
      >
      >  - Unwarranted improvements in profit margins and a large jump in certain assets
      >  - A big unexpected decline in free cash flow, with an equally sizable increase in cash flow from operations
      >  - Unexpected increases in capital expenditures that belie the company's original guidance and market conditions

      > Facing pressure from investors to continue its 11-quarter streak of out-performance, CFO Steven Neil orchestrated a scheme in which the company would pay the walnut growers to make them whole for the 2009 crop, but they would call the payment an "advance" on the next year's crop. This sleight of hand gave Neil the justificaion he needed to capitalize these payments on the Balance Sheet, rather than expense them in the current year. Despite this sneaky trick, the walnut growers knew that this payment was not really an advance on the 2010 crop; rather it related to the already-delivered 2009 crop.

   2. Amortizing costs too slowly

      > A company that chooses an overly long depreciation or amortization period generally would be considered guilty of using aggressive accounting. A more serious offence, however, is a company's _changing to a longer period_. This often suggests that the company's business may be in trouble and that it feels compelled to change accounting assumptions to camouflage the deterioration.

   3. Failing to write down assets with impaired value
      
      > ... consider a piece of equipment that management first assumed would last for 10 years but that breaks down permanently during year 5. Once it's out of service, the original depreciation schedule should be abandoned, and the remaining asset balance must be oved to the Expense section immediately. If the company instead chooses to continue depreciating the asset according to the original 10-year plan, it will have failed to write down an appropriately capitalized cost that had later become impaired.
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > ... DSI [Days' Sales of Inventory][^3] standardizes the inventory balance relative to inventory sold (i.e., cost of good sold) in a period. This calculation helps investors determine whether an increase in the absolute level of inventory is in line with the overall growth of the business or whether it might be a harbinger of margin pressure.
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > An additional measure can be used to test whether an inventory buildup might be justified by upcoming demand: simply compare the growth in the absolute level of inventory with the company's expected revenue growth. If inventory growth far exceeds the expected sales growth, the inventory bulge is probably unwarranted and a concern for investors.

   4. Failing to record expenses for uncollectible receivables and devalued investments
      
      > ... companies can inflate earnings by failing to turn assets into expenses when a clear loss in value has occurred.
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > ... companies cannot just close their eyes and pray that all their receivables will eventually be collected.
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > Companies must routinely adjust their accounts receivable balance to reflect expected customer defaults. This entails recording an expense on the Income Statement ("bad debts expense") and a reduction of accounts receivable on the Balance Sheet (the "allowance for doubtful accounts," which offsets gross receivables). Failing to record sufficient bad debts expense, or inappropriately reversing past bad debts expense, creates artificial profits.

5. Employing techniques to hide expenses or losses
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Failing to record an expense at the appropriate amount from a current transaction
      
      > ... aims to lower the period's total expenses by failing to record an actual obligation giving rise to an expense (like rent).
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > ... Symbol [a company] paid bonuses to employees in the March 2000 quarter but failed to record the related obligation to pay $3.5 million in Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) insurance.
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > Tell a supplier that you will agree to purchase $9 million of office products and that you will pay an inflated price od $10 million. In exchange for this large order, you ask the supplier to pay you a $1 million up-front "rebate" upon signing the agreement. You then improperly record the rebate as an immediate reduction of your office expenses. By using this trick, you have boosted earnings by the $1 millon receipt, which should have been recorded as a reduction of the inflated price of future office supplies purchases.

   2. Recording inappropriately low expenses by using aggresive accounting assumptions
      
      > In 2012, Deere [a company] estimated that the residual value of its rental equipment would aount to 55 percent of the initial value, leaving 45 percent of the initial cost to be depreciated. However, in each subsequent year, this estimate increases, reaching 63 percent in 2015. By increasing the estimate, the company would now be depreciating only 37 percent (down from 45 percent) of the initial value. Because of this subtle change in estimate of the residual value, Deere materially lowered its depreciation expense and artificially boosted its gross margin and operating income.
      > 
      > ...
      >
      > Just a simple change in the month designated as the measurement date for the pension plan can inflate profits. For example, in 2004, Raytheon Co. changed the date on whic it measured its pension plan from October 31 to December 31. This simple change provided a $41 million ($0.09 bump to earnings per share) bottom-line boost, which accounted for about 10 percent of Raytheon's earnings for the entire year.

   3. Reducing expenses by releasing reserves from previous charges
      
      > Reserves come in different shapes and sizes and can be found all over the Balance Sheet. ... reserves [can be] recorded on the Balance Sheet as offsets to assets, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, the allowance for loan losses, and inventory obsolescence reserves. ... While accrual accounting reuires companies to create a reserve for costs incurred but not yet expended (such as warranties), these reserves can easily be abused to manipulate earnings.

6. Shifting current income to a later period

   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Creating reserves and releasing them into income in a later period
      
      > When business is booming and earnings far exceed Wall Street estimates, companies may be tempted not to report all their revenue, but instead to save some of it for a rainy day. ... storing it [earnings] on the Balance Sheet until it is needed during a later period.

   2. Smoothing income by improperly accounting for derivatives
      
      > Companies with healthy businesses can engage in income-smoothing shenanigans to give the illusion of nice, steady, predictable results. Consider mortgage giant Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac, or Freddie) and its desire to portray very smooth earnings despite a period of volative interest rate movements. Freddie's attempts to smooth earnings went to the extreme and led to a $5 billon fraud.

   3. Creating reserves in conjunction with an acqusition and releasing them into income in a later period

      > ... acquisitive companies create some of the biggest challenges for investors. ... combined companies immediately become more difficult to analyze on an apples-to-apples basis. ... acquisition accounting rules create distortions in the presentation of cash flow from operations. ... companies making acquisitions might be tempted to have the target company hold back some revenue that was earned before the deal closes so that the acquirer can record it in the later period.

   4. Recording current-period sales in a later period
      
      > ... it is unlikely that the auditors will even know about this trick, and your customers certainly won't object since they will get billed later than they expected. ... it portrays higher sales in the later period.

7. Shifting future expenses to the current period
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Improperly writing off assets in the current period to avoid expenses in a future period
      
      > ... AOL had accumulated more than $314 million in the asset account labeled "deferred membership acquisition costs" (DMAC). But the company still had a big problem: those costs represented tomorrow's expense, and they would need to be amortized over the next eight quarters&mdash;a $40 million hit to earnings each quarter. ... AOL switched gears by announcing "a one-time charge" to write off the entire amount in one fell swoop. ... it had to come up with a justification to convince the auditors that this asset account had suddenly become "impaired" and would provide no future benefit. So AOL claimed that the write-off was necessary to reflect changes in its evolving business model, including rediced reliance on subscribers' fees as the company developed other revenue source.

   2. Improperly recording charges to establish reserves used to reduce future expenses

      > ... company that is taking a restructuring charge (such as laying off workers) might consider padding the total dollars written off to lower future-period operating expenses. Thus, salary expense to employees who are laid off today will decline in future periods, as any future severance payments received will be bundled into today's one-time charge. The result: future periods' above-the-line operating expense disappears, and the current period's below-the-line restructuring charge increases by that same amount.

### Cash Flow Shenanigans

> ... high net income along with low CFFO (Cash Flow from Operations) often signals the presence of some **Earnings Manipulation Shenanigans**

1. Shifting Financing cash inflows to the Operating section
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Recording bogus CFFO (Cash Flow from Operations) from a normal bank borrowing

      > Delphi went to its bank (Bank One) and offered to sell it $200 million in precious metals inventory. Not surprisingly, Bank One had no interest in buying inventory. Remember, we are talking about a bank, not an auto parts manufacturer. Delphi understood this and crafted the agreement in such a way that Bank One would be able to "sell" the inventory back to Delphi a few weeks later (after year-end). In exchange for the bank's "ownership" of the inventory for a few weeks, Delphi would buy it back at a small premium to the original sale price.
      >
      > ...
      >
      > Delphi should have recorded the $200 million received from Bank One as a borrowing (an increase in cash flow from financing activities).
      >
      > ...
      >
      > Delphi brazenly recorded it as the sale of $200 million in inventory [placing it under cash flow from operating activities]. In so doing, Delphi inflated revenue and earnings ...


   2. Boosting CFFO by selling receivables before the collection date
      
      > In 2004, pharmaceutical distributor Cardinal Health needed to generate a lot more cash. So management decided to sell accounts receivable to help the company raise cash very quickly. By the end of the second quarter (December 2004), Cardinal Health had sold $800 million in customer receivables. This transaction was the primary driver of the company's robust $971 million in CFFO growth in December 2004 over the prior-year period.

   3. Inflating CFFO by faking the sale of receivables
      
      > ... Peregrine [a company] transferred its receivables to a bank in exchange for cash; however, the risk of collection loss remained with Peregrine. That collection risk was huge, of course, because _there were no customers_&mdash;many of the related risk of loss had not been transferred, Peregrine remained on the hook to return the cash to the bank when the receivables inevitably were not collected.
      > 
      > Since the receivables had never actually been transferred, the economics of this transaction would be more akin to a collaterized loan, .... Peregrine borrowed money from the bank and used receivables as collateral. On the Statement of Cash Flows, this should be presented as a _Financing_ inflow. Peregrine, however, ignored the economic reality of the situation. Instead, it recorded the transaction as the sale of receivables and shamelessly reported the cash received as an _Operating_ inflow.

2. Moving cash outflows from the Operating section to other sections
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Inflating CFFO with boomerang transactions
      
      > Global Crossing sold large blocks of future network capacity to telecom customers. At the same time, the company purchased a similar dollar amount of capacity from these same customers. In other words, Global Crossing would sell capacity to a customer and _simultaneously buy a similar amount of capacity_ on a different network. This was a classic _boomerang_ transaction. You can almost picture some Global Crossing executive telling the company's customers, "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours."
      >
      > So what does this have to do with cash flow? Well, Global Crossing recorded these boomerang transactions in a way that artificially inflated CFFO. The company recorded the cash that it received from its customers in these transactions as an Operating inflow; however, the cash that it paid to the same customers was recorded as an Investing outflow. Essentially, Global Crossing inflated cash flow from operating activities by depressing cash flow from investing activities.

   2. Improperly capitalizing normal operating costs
      
      > Recording normal operating costs as an asset rather than as an expense sounds simple, and frankly, it is quite easy to do. However, it is one of the scariest and most lethal shenanigans out there. Why? Because it is a simple sleight of hand that does more than just embellish earnings&mdash;it inflates operating cash flow as well.
      >
      > ... By classifying billions of dollars of normal operating costs as capital equipment purchases, WorldCom not only artificially inflated its profits, but it also overstated its CFFO.

   3. Recording the purchase of inventory as an investing outflow
      
      > The economics of purchasing goods to be sold to customers suggests that these purchases should be classified as an operating activity on the Statement of Cash Flows. Normally, this would be the case. Curiously, some companies treat these purchases as an Investing ourflow.
      >
      > ...
      > 
      > While Netflix's Income Statement appropriately reflected the economics of its DVD costs, its Statement of Cash Flows did not. You would think that the purchase of DVDs would have been presented on the SCF as an operating outflow just like the purchase of any inventory particularly the purchase of the new releases that were amortized for only one year). However, Netflix did not see it that way. Instead, it considered the purchase of DVDs to be the purchase of a capital asset, and therefore the cash outflows were presented in the Investing section. This treatment effectively moved a big cash outflow (payment for DVDs) from the Operating to the investing section, thereby inflating CFFO.

   4. Shifting operating cash outflows off the Statement of Cash Flows
      
      > Most companies with an employee pension plan fund those plans with cash that is invested to grow and meet the company's projected long-term obligations. These contributions have the unfortunate effect of reducing reported cash flows. What if pensions could be funded without depleting precious cash flow?
      >
      > In 2011, Diageo (maker of spirits including Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Guinness) funded its U.K. pension scheme with GBP535 million of whiskey. As the whiskey ages, its value would increase, improving the funded status of the plan. All the while, reported cash flows remain unaffected.

3. Boosting operating cash flow using unsustainable activities
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Boosting CFFO by paying vendors more slowly
      
      > Want to save a little more cash this year? Use your "delay-payments" lifeline: wait until the beginning of January to pay your December bills. If you push your payments out a month, your end-of-year bank balance will be higher, and it will cosmetically seem as if you generated more cash this year.

   2. Boosting CFFO by collecting from customers more quickly
      
      > For high-end electric automaker Tesla Motors, liquidity and cash flow have been particularly important metrics for investors and lenders. Since its found in 2003, Tesla had never posted a full year of positive free cash flow, and therefore the company had become entirely reliant on debt financing and equity issuances to continue funding its operations. In 2016, Tesla's operating cash outflows appeared to have improved, amounting to net outflows of $124 million, down from outflows of $524 million in 2015. However, what changed most significantly in terms of cash flow that year was that the company _began accepting orders and refundable customer deposits_ for its Model 3 sedan, which had been introduced only in concept. These deposits accounted for $350 million of additional inflows, or 88 percent of the reported improvement in 2016. Skeptical investors would have noted that fundamentally the business continued to burn cash at historical rates, but because of a successful marketing campaign, it was able to "borrow" from future periods and accelerate customer payments to report better results.

   3. Boosting CFFO by purchasing less inventory
      
      > Home Depot lowered its inventory levels simply by not restocking shelves after goods had been sold. In other words, the company just did not purchase as much inventory from vendors as in previous years.
      >
      > ... a company choosing to purchase less inventory would also provide an artificial and unsustainable boost to CFFO.

   4. Boosting CFFO with one-time benefits
      
      > ... Sun Microsystems, pocketed nearly $2 billion from Microsoft in 2004 ($1.6 billion of which was immediately recognized as income). Sun presented this large one-time item in plain view on its Statement of Operations, listing it separately as "settlement income." Sun's disclosure made it very easy for investors to understand that the income from this settlement was nonrecurring and unrelated to its normal operations; it was reported "below the line" as nonoperating income.
      >
      > Sun's Statement of Cash Flows, however, was less clear. The company recorded the $2 billion in cash as an operating inflow (as is appropriated under the indirect method), but it was not listed separately on the SCF; rather it was simply bondled with net income.

### Key Metrics Shenanigans

1. Showcasing misleading metrics that overstate performance
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Highlighting a misleading metric as a surrogate for revenue
      
      > Companies often prominently disclose SSS (_same-store sales_) in their Earnings Releases, and investors use it as a key indicator of company performance.
      >
      > ...
      >
      > However, because SSS fall outside of GAAP coverage, no universally accepted definition exists, and calculations may vary from company to company.

   2. Highlighting a misleading metric as a surrogate for earnings
      
      > ... management removed $97 million in expenses for interest, tax, depreciation and some other items to to a metric it called _adjusted EBITDA_ (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Then, it removed $15 million in non-cash stock compensation expense, bringing the company to and adjusted cash EBITDA of _negative_ $8 million.

   3. Highlighting a misleading metric as a surrogate for cash flow
      
      > Companies sometimes present metrics like "cash earnings" or "cash EBITDA" (as we just saw with Global Crossing). Do not confuse these metrics with substitutes for cash flow! Many companies and investors alike believe that these metrics (as well as plain old EBITDA) are good surrogates for cash flow simply because the calculation includes the adding back of noncash expenses such as depreciation.

2. Distorting Balance Sheet metrics to avoid showing deterioration
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Distorting accounts receivable metrics to hide revenue problems
      
      Mentioned under Cash Flow Shenanigans in ***Boosting CFFO by selling receivables before the collection date***

   2. Distorting inventory metrics to hide profitability problems
      
      Mentioned under Cash Flow Shenanigans in ***Boosting operating cash flow using unsustainable activities***

   3. Distorting financial asset metrics to hide impairment problems
      
      > New Century realized that investors would be seriously spooked if they knew that the company had reduced its reserves while its subprime loan portfolio was souring and that this reduction was the primary driver of earnings. Indeed, analysts who followed New Century were monitoring the company's allowance for loan losses closely as the subprime market started to crack. So when the company released its September 2006 results, management quietly changed its reserve presentation. ... the company grouped the loan loss reserve with another reserve (allowances for real estate owned) and presented the two together as one unit ... By combining the two reserves, New Century could say in its release that reserves increased from $236.5 million in June to $239 .4 million in September. However, the number on which investors had previously been focused&mdash;the loan loss reserve&mdash;declined from $209.9 million to $191.6 million. The loan loss reserve fell because bad loans that had been written off (call _charge-offs_) had accelerated and New Century had failed to record a sufficient expense to refill the reserve

   4. Distorting debt metrics to hide liquidity problems
      
      > The centerpiece of Parmalat's fraud seems to have been the company's use of offshore entities to hide fictitious or impaired assets, fabricate the reduction of debt, and create fake income. The scope of the fraudulent activities that Parmalat is alleged to have engaged in is quite amazing. SEC litigation against the company names a few, including forging the repurchase of its debt, faking the sale of bogus or uncollectible receivables, falsifying the payment of payables, recording fictional revenue, mischaracterizing debt as equity, disguising intercompany loans as income, and diverting company cash to various bisinesses owned by members of the CEO's family.

### Acquisition Accounting Shenanigans

1. Artificially boosting revenue and earnings
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Inflating profits through tricks at a target company before a deal closes
      
      > ... the goal of the target and acquirer: to make the postclosing period beautiful. One way to accomplish this goal is to depress earnings in the period just before the deal&mdash;called the _stub period_.

   2. Inflating profits by hiding losses at deal closing
      
      > Around 2008, Olympus had bought three companies and paid far more than they were worth, according to Woodford. This inflated price (totaling 30 percent of the deal value) was labeled "fees to a middleman." Woodford pointed out that the cut for investment bankers typically would be 1 to 2 percent, so the $674 million paid on the $2 billion deals likely was a payment to cover losses and move the investments off the Balance Sheet to an unconsolidated related-party entity.

   3. Creating dubious new revenue streams after closing
      
      > Both buyers and sellers of businesses have great flexibility in structuring a deal to create dubious future revenue streams. For example, assume Buyer Ben wants to purchase Seller Same's business, and they come to terms on a price of $5 million, which is the fair market value of the company. Buyer Ben then says to Seller Sam, "I will instead pay you $6 million (rather than the $5 million), provided you also agree to pay me a $1 million licensing fee next year." This change has no real economic impact to either Buyer Ben or Seller Sam, but the change in structure allows Ben to show $1 million more in revenue in the year following the acquisition.

   4. Inflating profits by releasing suspicious reserves either before or just after closing
      
      > The acquirer can also set up a bigger-than-necessary reserve for contingent consideration payments that might be paid to the owners of the target company, then later release some of the reserves back into income when they are deemed unnecessary.

2. Inflating reported cash flow
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Inheriting operating inflows in a normal business acquisition
      
      > ... the mere act of acquiring a company provides benefit to CFFO. ... it's a peculiar side effect from the accounting rules that segregate cash flows into three sections
      >
      > Imagine you are a company that is getting ready to make a business acquisition. When you pay for the acquisition, you do so without affecting CFFO. If you buy the company with cash, the payment is recorded as an _investing outflow_. If you offer stock instead, there is, of course, no cash outflow.

   2. Acquiring contracts or customers rather than developing them internally
      
      > Among the hundreds of businesses Tyco owned was an electronic security monitoring provider. Home security monitoring was a fast-growing industry in the 1990s, and Tyco's ADT division proved to be among the most popular brand names. Tyco generated new security systems contracts in two ways: through its own direct sales force and through an external network of dealerships. The dealers allowed Tyco to outsource a portion of its sales force. They were not on Tyco's payroll, but they sold security contracts, and Tyco paid them about $800 for every new customer.
      >
      > ... Tyco executives did not view these $800 payments to dealers to be normal customer solicitation costs, as the economics would suggest. Instead, they deemed these payments to be a purchase price for the "acquisitions" of contracts.
      >
      > ... customer solicitation costs resemble normal operating expenditures much more closely than they resemble business acquisitions. As a result, it makes more sense for them to be recorded on the Statement of Cash Flows in the same way that Tyco's internal sales force commissions are recorded: as operating outflows.

   3. Boosting CFFO by creatively structuring the sale of a business
      
      This is basically doing an Earnings Manipulation after acquisition as mentioned under ***Creating reserves in conjunction with an acqusition and releasing them into income in a later period***

3. Manipulating key metrics
   
   > Sometimes a company will acquire a competitor in order to wind down a competing product and move the target's customers onto the acquirer's platform. This may be a good business strategy, but it could wreak havoc with organic growth metrics. For example, 3D printer manufacturer 3D Systems acquired competitor Z-Corp in 2012 and quickly announced that it would discontinue some of Z-Corp's products. Naturally, Z-Corp's revenue fell after being acquired, and 3D Systems reported strong organic growth. Any revenue growth that 3D Systems derived from legacy Z-Corp customers should not be considered organic.
