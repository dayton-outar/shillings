# Business Plan

***Shillings*** is the first story-based stock trading platform. Its goal is to reach the global stock trading market by bringing an immersive experience for tracking and trading securities.

Publicly listed companies and their investors have their stories surrounding the drama of its development and performance. Companies attempt to tell these stories in the quarterly and annual reports. _Shillings_ brings a different perspective of how to interpret ticker symbols and numbers to increase the participation rate in the various stock exchanges around the world.

## The Problem

***Some stock markets offer a disjointed[^1] and perplexing experience that discourages lively participation.***

As those markets around the world become more exposed to technology, a greater tension is created between investors and the key players of the stock market. This tension will create a greater demand for tools to help the investors make better trading decisions at progressively faster pace. Markets that experience this tension are _underserved_. This solution addresses _underserved markets_.

According to _Underscore.VC_,

> If you can’t deliver a 10x gain of adoption/pain of adoption, customers will typically default to inertia and will “do nothing” rather than bear the risk of working with you.

To determine if this product will deliver 10 times the gains compared to alternative products, metrics must be defined and used. Metrics that include factors like time saved, cost reduction, increased efficiency and improved performance. Evaluate alternative products in light of these metrics and use as a comparative baseline. Here are some metrics to measure performance,

- Speed: transactions per second, requests per minute
- Accuracy: percentage of correct vs incorrect outputs
- Innovation: number of new features or industry recognition

The solution is projected to be a **discontinuous** innovation with a **defensible** technology and a **disruptive** business model. It's _discontinuous_ because it takes a different look at representing information from the stock market. It contains intellectual property that is _somewhat defensible_. It's aim is to deliver value and reduce cost to increase participation.

We definitely have to be cognizant that quality is important but branding and speed of delivery to market is more important. We need to avoid the trap of _faster, better and cheaper_.[^3] The aim is to deliver a unique perspective of consuming information to an _underserved_ market.

### Stories We Want To Tell

_Knows Nothing_ is interested in the stock market but he knows nothing. When he goes to the stock exchange's web site he is baffled by the symbols and numbers. He's so overwhelmed that he decides not to bother to participate in the stock market. He meets _Tracy Trader_ after noticing her participating in stock trading at a site called ***Shillings***, he becomes curious again because of the visual appeal and the story-based approach that the site offers. He's fascinated by the various businesses and he learns one multiple at a time as they are given context and described in short phrases. He eventually gains confidence to open a trading account and test out his trades on the mock trading platform. _Knows Nothing_ is now excited to fund his trading account so that he can trade on the real trading platform on ***Shillings***. _Knows Nothing_ has begun his journey as an investor and stock trader.

_Tracy Trader_ has enough financial literacy to understand financial statements and calculate multiples from them but when it comes to choosing an IPO to purchase she lacks confidence in taking risks due to overwhelming number of multiples and company information to cover in a prospectus. She solves this problem by following a community of experts. Not all the time the experts get it right. Sometimes when she listens to the experts she takes over a year before she can sell units to make capital gains profit, if any at all. When _Tracy_ found ***Shillings***, she had access to an _IPO Scorecard_ and an _Expert's Rating System_, which gave her more confidence and efficiency in analysing IPOs and deciding whether or not to purchase IPOs.

_Chris Charts_ makes his trading decisions based on the market behaviour by analysing BUY and SELL orders and studying price action and volume in charts. He is frustrated with the lack of technical analysis and access to real-time (minute-by-minute) trading information. He resorts to going [investing.com](https://www.investing.com/), which gives him the technical analysis but only a day later. It's not what he wants but it's the best he can get for now that's until _Tracy Trader_ introduced him to ***Shillings***. With ***Shillings***, he was able to access real-time BUY and SELL orders and study them in the technical charts provided. Furthermore, he was able to make the trades right there from the screen he was studying the technicals. _Chris_ is glad he found ***Shillings***.

_Ingrid Investor_ invests in the stock market as part of her pension plan. She is more interested in long-term investment in business that will grow in value and pay dividends for a long time. She is entertained by intrinsic evaluation, financial reports analysis and news about the leadership and performance of the companies associated with the stocks chosen in her portfolio. She doesn't have much time to delve into these _fundamentals_ but every now and then when she has the time she visits [SimplyWall.st](https://simplywall.st/), where she can view a comprehensive fundamental analysis of the companies associated with stocks in her portfolio. It would have been perfect there if the information wasn't so overwhelming. She can pick out a few metrics to put them in context but most metrics and information have no context. It seemed to expert for her until she found ***Shillings***. ***Shillings*** offered a graphical immersive story-telling approach that put context to every metric shared. It was from that point, that _Ingrid_ started to learn more and appreciate not only the increasing value of the companies but the stories of how well the business is performing.

## Purpose

### Founder's Backstory

Why did I build Shillings?

1. I wanted to better understand the market response to a stock over a span of 10 years to get an idea of the risk and possibilities. This was technical analysis. Getting the history over that period of time was not easily visualized by the Jamaica Stock Exchange.

2. I wanted to compare fundamental ratios like profit margin and liquidity but no easy way of doing this was offered on the Jamaica Stock Exchange. This was done for the US Stock Exchange on the Google Finance website (also Yahoo Finance). Reports were not consolidated into one central place.

3. Basic company profile was not offered by the Jamaica Stock Exchange. Value investors need to know the story of each company. There's more to a Stock Exchange than the stock prices. The company's listed are usually the main contributors to an economy and offer goods and services within the local and global marketplace.

### The Mission

Shillings seeks to deliver structured information in a visually appealing way with succinct context to engage novice and experienced investors.

Consumers are not satisfied with the manner in which information is presented by the Jamaica Stock Exchange. They want the most up-to-date information presented in a manner that is easy to understand.

### Brokerage Opportunity

Another important business idea for consideration is to start a brokerage firm, where this product will be used to access the services of the broker. According to Jamaican laws (the Securities Act[^2]),

Individuals eligible for a dealer's licence includes the following,

1. he satisfies one of the following requirements, that is to say—

   > (i) he holds a degree in economics, accounting or business related subjects; or
   > 
   > (ii) has a professional qualification in law or accounting; or
   > 
   > (iii) has successfully completed a programme of study in securities approved by the Commission; and
 
2. has worked for at least two years in the securities industry; and
 
3. has a net worth of at least ten million dollars or has acquired indemnity insurance for at least that amount.

These are the requirements for starting a stock brokerage. If those requirements can be met, then that firm can use this as a way to position itself to members of the market that want a real-time digitized approach to the business of trading stocks.

## Monetization

"The whales pay for the minnows". I think ultimately, the best monetization strategy is to,

1. Build customer base by offering analytical tools and trading free of cost. This will cost the business.

2. Once critical mass of customer base is arrived, companies listed on the stock exchange can be charged to better prepare their customer profile to appeal to investors. A subscription fee for seamless advertising. Offer a subscription for companies to have an enhanced profile, including additional multimedia content, promotional materials, and priority placement on your website.

3. After critical mass of businesses subscribing, customers who want special services can be charged. (Need to figure those special services: access to historical archives of company reports and other related history of listed companies)

Step 1 may take 4 to 5 years.

If this project leads into the setting up of a brokerage, then there will be an opportunity to earn from each trade made on the platform by getting brokerage fee as currently done on [JTrader Pro](./MARKETING/INDUSTRY/JM.md#jtrader-pro).

## The Market

The research done on the [market](./MARKETING/MARKET/) and the [industry](./MARKETING/INDUSTRY/) confirms that technology and communities around the world are actively developing in harmony with each other to deliver a pure digital experience to investors. Currently, some digital experience is not as efficient in some jurisdiction as it is in others. There's still heavy use of PDF documents as forms and manual approval systems used by staff members of brokerage firms (stock brokers). The brokers dependendency on their Government's infrastructure limits their ability to fully automate KYC responsibilities. The choice of funding stock trading accounts on trading platforms also requires manual approval though the brokers interact with software to do so. Even with some of the mentioned disharmony, there are still significant developments taking place by a number of fintech conglomerates. And, even though these conglomerates are closing gaps to provide a great digitized experience for investors, there is still room for improvement that startups can capitalize on.

![Minimum Viable Segment](/.attachments/minimum.viable.segment-4.png)

Six (6) minimum viable segments were identified that [this product can bring value](./MARKETING/VALUE.md). They include 4 types of investor profiles, the brokers and the listed companies.

### Pain Points

So, starting off with the [Jamaican market](./MARKETING/MARKET/JM.md) and the players in [that industry](./MARKETING/INDUSTRY/JM.md), the most common pain points for investors are,
1. Lack of real-time technical analysis
2. Disjointed information on stocks and associated companies

_Real-time technical analysis_ is vital to short-term investors because timely trades can preserve their gains and prevent losses. _Disjointed information_ can affect learning experience and exhaust even experienced investors. These pain points is all about the ease of gathering information to understand the companies and the stock market in a moment in time so that the best decision can be made.

The greatest pain point for the brokers is the lack of capital to automate the KYC and fund-in/fund-out requests for investors.

Listed companies always want to communicate to their investors in the best way possible.

### Budget

[Some investors](./MARKETING/MARKET/JM.md#interviews) are willing to pay as low as US$1 to as high as US$35 per month for the features mentioned in the [value proposition](./MARKETING/VALUE.md).

### Channel

As stated in the [marketing strategy](#strategy), the main channel will be outreach to the various communities, clubs and influencers that meet to discuss investment opportunities on the Jamaica Stock Exchange.

### Product Use Case

Usage scenarios are outlined in [value proposition](./MARKETING/VALUE.md).

### Customer Profile

Also referred to as buyer persona in [value proposition](./MARKETING/VALUE.md).

### Unique Selling Propositions

After examining the various communities and [tech solutions](./MARKETING/INDUSTRY/JM.md#competitors), the unique selling propositions that this product offers includes,
1. Integrated learning environment
2. Integrated social environment
   1. Rating systems: Expert's, Company's, Brokers
   2. Share ways to make gains
   3. Share forecasts
3. Visually immersive experience
4. News sentiment interpreter (bullish, bearish, neutral)
5. Interactive financial reports
   1. Hyperactive links to auditor's notes
   2. Shenanigan's notes
   3. Expert's notes
6. Buffet's performance checklist

_Integrated learning environment_ is built to engage and immerse the users into a progressive but contextual exposure of information. It's not taken for granted that terms, ticker symbols and numbers are understood by the user. Short snippets of information and _affordances_ are used to guide investors through the fundamental and technical material in a teacher-directed fashion.

_Integrated social environment_ contains features to facilitate the natural urge for us to share and learn from others.

_Visually immersive experience_ makes use of graphics to engage and explain information published by companies. This all depends on the graphical work published in the companies' annual reports.

_New sentiment interpreter_ is an automated tool that interprets news articles as bullish, bearish or neutral for certain industries and companies.

_Interactive financial reports_ makes use of the rich interactive experience that can be provided in a web page. PDF documents provided by companies that are difficult to navigate will be rerendered to provide this experience. An experience that includes expert's notes and comments, including identifying financial shenanigan's.

_Buffet's performance checklist_ is a scorecard of the company to which the stock is associated. It scores a company on its _durable competitive advantage_.

The unique selling propositions will be delivered according to our [UX design philosophy](./EXPERIENCE/).

### Marketing Strategy

The strategy to bring awareness to the product involves practicing the philosophy of using the _smallest viable market_ to develop the product while in its infancy stage (beta phase). The members chosen for the _smallest viable market_ will include about 7 investors that are described in the 4 different buyer personas explained in the [value proposition](./MARKETING/VALUE.md#investors). These members are expected to be part of a wider social network of investors to which they will share their experience. It's pretty much a grassroots approach.

As the word spreads, members will be brought on-board through a referral registration system, where the system provides a token to the prospect. For future reference, members can be rewarded and incentivized to expand membership. The initial membership will allow access but not trading, since trading will require KYC requirements of each new prospect.

In addition to this approach, we will reach out to [communities and influencers in the industry](./MARKETING/INDUSTRY/JM.md#communities-and-thought-leaders) to deliver a branded presentation. A _branded presentation_ involves the use of logos, catchy name and slogans to conduct a live presentation of the product.

Advertisements will not be necessary until there's significant traction and renown of the product. Advertisements will not be used to bring awareness but to state the claim that the product is the leader of its category in the market.

SEO strategy will be considered after 2,000 members ar actively using the product or a decision is made to enter into the US market.

### Sales Approach

If we do arrive at a freemium model, the referral model will be used to engage the sales. It is a far less aggressive approach.

A business-to-business sales model maybe considered, where listed companies pay to organize their profiles and promote their stock to investors.

Both sales and monetization is not fully decided.

### Brand Awareness

The [brand philosophy](./BRANDING/) that will be embraced is one that places ***Shillings*** as the first of its kind in a new category. ***Shillings*** so far is the first story-based trading platform that provides an immersive experience that engages young people from the age of 18 up to participate more in the stock market. Any avatar, logo, slogan and color theme that projects fortune and vibrance are brand statements that we plan to use. As it relates to the name, we can rebrand ***Shillings*** to use the Google model, where a new word is created but a word that has at most 2 syllables. If the word has to have "stocks" in it, then we can stretch the name to accommodate 3 syllables, at most.

## Finance and Operations

The financial projections and overall operations of this business can be found within this section.

### Corporate Structure

- ? Inc. is the corporation established to manage the products and services offered by Shillings.

### Key Management Personnel

- Dayton Outar: CEO
- ?: Cheif Financial Officer
- ?: Director

![Shillings Business Canvas](/.attachments/shillings.business.canvas-2.png)

### Financing Strategy

The _Shillings_ project will be conservative on the use of debt to finance it's initial _research and development_. It will initially be financed through a combination of strategies including the use of: 
- personal savings and funds from founders
- sweat equity, 
- strategic partnerships and 
- revenue generation.

This approach reduces reliance on external financing and preserves equity. We plan to encourage team members to invest their time and skills in exchange for equity rather than immediate compensation. This aligns incentives and conserves cash for essential expenses.

We embrace a lean approach to operations, minimizing unnecessary expenses and overhead costs. This includes negotiating favorable terms with suppliers, using cost-effective marketing channels, and optimizing resource allocation.

Currently, the labour for _Research and Development_ is the highest cost in the initial stage. Since the founder is an engineer, he will use his time and skill to complete the following milestones,

In addition, marketing research will be done by him.

A group of seven (7) persons will be asked to volunteer their time to test the product after the completion of these milestones. Those seven (7) persons will be provided an equity stake based on the value of their labour, which will be outlined in the budget. The completion of this test phase can be referred to as _Beta V_.

It is while promoting the product, after _Beta V_, that consideration will be given to borrowing funds to conduct marketing campaigns in the various investment communities and clubs islandwide.

### Budget

Creating a budget for a tech startup involves considering various factors such as personnel costs, technology infrastructure, marketing expenses, and operational costs. Below is a simplified example of a budget for a tech startup:

1. **Personnel Costs:**
   - Salaries for founders, developers, designers, and other employees.
   - Payroll taxes and benefits (health insurance, retirement plans, etc.).
   - Freelance or contractor fees if applicable.
   
2. **Technology Infrastructure:**
   - Cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) for hosting.
   - Software licenses and subscriptions (e.g., development tools, project management software).
   - Hardware costs (computers, servers, networking equipment).
   
3. **Marketing and Sales:**
   - Website development and maintenance.
   - Digital marketing (social media advertising, search engine optimization).
   - Sales and marketing tools (CRM software, email marketing platforms).
   
4. **Operational Costs:**
   - Office rent or coworking space fees.
   - Utilities (electricity, internet).
   - Legal and accounting fees.
   - Travel and transportation expenses.
   
5. **Miscellaneous Expenses:**
   - Office supplies.
   - Training and professional development.
   - Contingency fund for unexpected expenses.

It's important to adjust the budget based on the specific needs and circumstances of the startup. Additionally, it's wise to regularly review and update the budget as the business grows and evolves.

Here's a breakdown of a sample budget for a tech startup:

| Category              | Monthly Budget ($) | Annual Budget ($) |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Personnel Costs       | $20,000            | $240,000          |
| Technology Infrastructure | $5,000          | $60,000           |
| Marketing and Sales   | $10,000            | $120,000          |
| Operational Costs     | $5,000             | $60,000           |
| Miscellaneous Expenses| $2,000             | $24,000           |
| **Total**             | **$42,000**        | **$504,000**      |

This budget is just a starting point and should be adjusted based on the specific needs and goals of the startup. It's also important to track actual expenses against the budget to ensure financial health and make necessary adjustments.

Please note that the figures provided are for illustrative purposes only and may vary significantly based on the size, location, industry, and other factors affecting the startup. Confidence level: Medium. This is a simplified example and actual budgets can vary widely based on the specific circumstances of each startup.

### Financial Projections

Here are some key assumptions to consider:

1. **Market Size and Growth**: Estimate the total addressable market (TAM) for the immersive stock trading platform in Jamaica, considering factors such as the number of active traders, trading volume, and market penetration potential. Project the growth rate of the market over the forecast period based on historical data and expected industry trends.

2. **Customer Acquisition**: Estimate the cost of acquiring customers for the platform, including marketing and sales expenses. Determine the conversion rate of leads to customers based on user acquisition strategies such as advertising, partnerships, and referrals.

3. **Revenue Model**: Define the revenue model for the platform, considering options such as subscription fees, transaction fees, premium features, and advertising revenue. Estimate the average revenue per user (ARPU) and project revenue growth over time based on user adoption and pricing strategies.

4. **User Growth**: Forecast the number of active users on the platform, taking into account factors such as market demand, competitive landscape, and customer retention. Consider how user engagement, platform features, and customer support may impact user growth rates.

5. **Market Share**: Estimate the company's market share within the Jamaican stock trading market and track changes over time. Consider competitive dynamics, barriers to entry, and differentiation strategies that may affect market share growth.

6. **Operating Expenses**: Project operating expenses including technology development, infrastructure costs, employee salaries, marketing expenses, regulatory compliance, and administrative overhead. Consider scalability and efficiency improvements over time as the platform matures.

7. **Technology Infrastructure**: Assess the technology infrastructure required to support the platform's functionality, performance, and security. Estimate costs related to software development, hosting, data storage, cybersecurity, and platform maintenance.

8. **Regulatory Environment**: Consider regulatory factors that may impact the operation of the stock trading platform in Jamaica, such as licensing requirements, compliance costs, and changes in financial regulations. Stay informed about regulatory developments and adapt financial forecasts accordingly.

9. **Economic Conditions**: Take into account macroeconomic factors that may influence stock market activity and investor behavior in Jamaica, such as GDP growth, inflation rates, interest rates, and geopolitical events. Monitor economic indicators and adjust financial forecasts as needed.

10. **Risk Factors**: Identify and assess potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the financial performance of the company, such as technological challenges, market competition, regulatory changes, and external shocks. Develop contingency plans to mitigate risks and preserve financial stability.

By incorporating these assumptions into financial forecasts, you can develop a comprehensive outlook for the tech company's immersive stock trading platform in Jamaica, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.

#### Income Statement

Sure, here's an example of an income statement projection for a hypothetical tech stock trading company operating in Jamaica. This projection assumes a three-year period and includes estimates for revenue, expenses, and net income:

```
Tech Stock Trading Company Income Statement Projection (Year 1 to Year 3)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                     Year 1         Year 2         Year 3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revenue:
   Subscription Fees               $500,000       $1,200,000      $2,500,000
   Transaction Fees                 $300,000        $800,000       $1,500,000
   Advertising Revenue               $50,000        $150,000        $300,000
                                    --------       ---------       ---------
Total Revenue                      $850,000       $2,150,000      $4,300,000

Expenses:
   Technology Development          $300,000        $500,000        $700,000
   Marketing and Sales             $150,000        $300,000        $500,000
   Employee Salaries               $200,000        $400,000        $600,000
   Infrastructure Costs            $100,000        $200,000        $300,000
   Regulatory Compliance            $50,000         $75,000        $100,000
   Administrative Overhead          $50,000         $75,000        $100,000
                                    --------       ---------       ---------
Total Expenses                     $850,000       $1,550,000      $2,300,000

Net Income (Loss)                       $0          $600,000      $2,000,000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Explanation of Assumptions:

1. **Revenue**: Revenue is generated from subscription fees, transaction fees charged on trades executed on the platform, and advertising revenue. The figures increase over the three-year period as the customer base grows and the platform gains traction in the market.

2. **Expenses**: Expenses include costs related to technology development, marketing and sales efforts to acquire customers, employee salaries, infrastructure maintenance, regulatory compliance, and administrative overhead. Some expenses may increase over time due to business growth and expansion.

3. **Net Income (Loss)**: Net income is calculated by subtracting total expenses from total revenue. In Year 1, the company may operate at breakeven or incur a loss as it invests in technology development and customer acquisition. However, net income improves in subsequent years as revenue grows and expenses are managed more efficiently.

It's important to note that these projections are based on assumptions and estimates, and actual results may vary. Regular monitoring and adjustment of financial forecasts are essential to reflect changes in market conditions, business performance, and other factors affecting the company's financial position.

   Retained Earnings                $1,100,000      $3,000,000      $4,650,000
                                     ---------       ---------       ---------
Total Equity                       $2,100,000      $5,000,000      $7,650,000

Total Liabilities and Equity       $2,250,000      $5,350,000      $8,300,000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Explanation of Assumptions:

1. **Assets**: The balance sheet includes various assets such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable (representing revenue yet to be collected), technology assets (e.g., software and hardware infrastructure), and investments. These assets increase over time as the company generates revenue, invests in technology development, and accumulates cash reserves.

2. **Liabilities**: Liabilities include accounts payable (e.g., unpaid bills), short-term debt (e.g., loans due within one year), and long-term debt (e.g., loans with longer repayment periods). The company may take on debt to finance operations, with some debt being repaid or refinanced over time.

3. **Equity**: Equity consists of common stock (representing ownership stakes held by investors) and retained earnings (accumulated profits reinvested in the business). Equity increases as the company raises capital through the issuance of stock and retains earnings generated from operations.

4. **Total Assets and Total Liabilities and Equity**: The balance sheet balances by ensuring that total assets equal total liabilities and equity, reflecting the fundamental accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity).

This balance sheet projection provides a snapshot of the company's financial position at the end of each year, showing how assets are financed through a combination of liabilities and equity. Regular review and adjustment of the balance sheet are necessary to reflect changes in the company's operations, financing activities, and overall financial health.

Explanation of Assumptions:

1. **Operating Activities**: Operating cash flow is derived from the company's net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and changes in working capital. Positive cash flow from operating activities indicates the company's ability to generate cash from its core business operations.

2. **Investing Activities**: Investing cash flow includes cash flows related to the acquisition and sale of assets, such as technology assets and investments. Negative cash flow from investing activities reflects cash outflows for capital expenditures.

3. **Financing Activities**: Financing cash flow comprises cash flows related to the company's financing activities, such as proceeds from debt issuance and equity financing (e.g., common stock). Positive cash flow from financing activities indicates cash inflows from external sources to fund the company's operations and growth initiatives.

4. **Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash**: The net increase (or decrease) in cash represents the change in the company's cash balance during the period. A positive net increase in cash indicates that the company's cash reserves are growing, while a negative net increase may indicate cash outflows exceeding inflows.

5. **Cash at Beginning and End of Year**: The cash balance at the beginning of the year is carried forward from the previous year, while the cash balance at the end of the year is calculated based on the net increase (or decrease) in cash during the period.

This cash flow statement projection provides insights into how cash is generated and used by the company over the forecast period, helping stakeholders assess the company's liquidity, financing needs, and overall financial health.
