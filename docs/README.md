# Business Plan

***Shillings*** is the first story-based stock trading platform. Its goal is to reach the global stock trading market by bringing an immersive experience for tracking and trading securities.

Publicly listed companies and their investors have their stories surrounding the drama of its development and performance. Companies attempt to tell these stories in the quarterly and annual reports. _Shillings_ brings a different perspective of how to interpret ticker symbols and numbers to increase the participation rate in the various stock exchanges around the world.

## The Problem

***Some stock markets offer a disjointed[^1] and perplexing experience that discourages lively participation.***

As those markets around the world become more exposed to technology, a greater tension is created between investors and the key players of the stock market. This tension will create a greater demand for tools to help the investors make better trading decisions at progressively faster pace. Markets that experience this tension are _underserved_. This solution addresses _underserved markets_.

According to _Underscore.VC_,

> If you can’t deliver a 10x gain of adoption/pain of adoption, customers will typically default to inertia and will “do nothing” rather than bear the risk of working with you.

To determine if this product will deliver 10 times the gains compared to alternative products, metrics must be defined and used. Metrics that include factors like time saved, cost reduction, increased efficiency and improved performance. Evaluate alternative products in light of these metrics and use as a comparative baseline. Here are some metrics to measure performance,

- Speed: transactions per second, requests per minute
- Accuracy: percentage of correct vs incorrect outputs
- Innovation: number of new features or industry recognition

The solution is projected to be a **discontinuous** innovation with a **defensible** technology and a **disruptive** business model. It's _discontinuous_ because it takes a different look at representing information from the stock market. It contains intellectual property that is _somewhat defensible_. It's aim is to deliver value and reduce cost to increase participation. It is _disruptive_ because it aims to significantly alter the current way of doing things in the stock market industry, specifically for the brokerage department. The questions it will ask of the stock brokerages in Jamaica are,

- What needs to be improved in the delivery of stock brokerage services?
- What manual processes can be automated and digitized?
  - Turnaround time for signing up to trade stocks (Making use of NIDs to verify prospective customer/trader identity)
  - Disclosure of identity information traded for value-added services based on progressive exposure of risk (public analysis for free; ability to do transaction requires government validity of identity)
  - User-friendly and contextual delivery of visualization of analytical information
  - Timely interpretation and analysis of annual financial reports and IPOs
  - Ease of trade orders via electronic means
  - Tracking of trade orders

We definitely have to be cognizant that quality is important but branding and speed of delivery to market is more important. We need to avoid the trap of _faster, better and cheaper_.[^3] The aim is to deliver a unique perspective of consuming information to an _underserved_ market.

### Stories We Want To Tell

_Knows Nothing_ is interested in the stock market but he knows nothing. When he goes to the stock exchange's web site he is baffled by the symbols and numbers. He's so overwhelmed that he decides not to bother to participate in the stock market. He meets _Tracy Trader_ after noticing her participating in stock trading at a site called ***Shillings***, he becomes curious again because of the visual appeal and the story-based approach that the site offers. He's fascinated by the various businesses and he learns one multiple at a time as they are given context and described in short phrases. He eventually gains confidence to open a trading account and test out his trades on the mock trading platform. _Knows Nothing_ is now excited to fund his trading account so that he can trade on the real trading platform on ***Shillings***. _Knows Nothing_ has begun his journey as an investor and stock trader.

_Tracy Trader_ has enough financial literacy to understand financial statements and calculate multiples from them but when it comes to choosing an IPO to purchase she lacks confidence in taking risks due to overwhelming number of multiples and company information to cover in a prospectus. She solves this problem by following a community of experts. Not all the time the experts get it right. Sometimes when she listens to the experts she takes over a year before she can sell units to make capital gains profit, if any at all. When _Tracy_ found ***Shillings***, she had access to an _IPO Scorecard_ and an _Expert's Rating System_, which gave her more confidence and efficiency in analysing IPOs and deciding whether or not to purchase IPOs.

_Chris Charts_ makes his trading decisions based on the market behaviour by analysing BUY and SELL orders and studying price action and volume in charts. He is frustrated with the lack of technical analysis and access to real-time (minute-by-minute) trading information. He resorts to going [investing.com](https://www.investing.com/), which gives him the technical analysis but only a day later. It's not what he wants but it's the best he can get for now that's until _Tracy Trader_ introduced him to ***Shillings***. With ***Shillings***, he was able to access real-time BUY and SELL orders and study them in the technical charts provided. Furthermore, he was able to make the trades right there from the screen he was studying the technicals. _Chris_ is glad he found ***Shillings***.

_Ingrid Investor_ invests in the stock market as part of her pension plan. She is more interested in long-term investment in business that will grow in value and pay dividends for a long time. She is entertained by intrinsic evaluation, financial reports analysis and news about the leadership and performance of the companies associated with the stocks chosen in her portfolio. She doesn't have much time to delve into these _fundamentals_ but every now and then when she has the time she visits [SimplyWall.st](https://simplywall.st/), where she can view a comprehensive fundamental analysis of the companies associated with stocks in her portfolio. It would have been perfect there if the information wasn't so overwhelming. She can pick out a few metrics to put them in context but most metrics and information have no context. It seemed to expert for her until she found ***Shillings***. ***Shillings*** offered a graphical immersive story-telling approach that put context to every metric shared. It was from that point, that _Ingrid_ started to learn more and appreciate not only the increasing value of the companies but the stories of how well the business is performing.

## Purpose

### Founder's Backstory

Why did I build Shillings?

1. I wanted to better understand the market response to a stock over a span of 10 years to get an idea of the risk and possibilities. This was technical analysis. Getting the history over that period of time was not easily visualized by the Jamaica Stock Exchange.

2. I wanted to compare fundamental ratios like profit margin and liquidity but no easy way of doing this was offered on the Jamaica Stock Exchange. This was done for the US Stock Exchange on the Google Finance website (also Yahoo Finance). Reports were not consolidated into one central place.

3. Basic company profile was not offered by the Jamaica Stock Exchange. Value investors need to know the story of each company. There's more to a Stock Exchange than the stock prices. The company's listed are usually the main contributors to an economy and offer goods and services within the local and global marketplace.

### The Vision

_To be the complete playground for stock investor's worldwide_

It's a bold vision that is focused on telling the stories of businesses worldwide. That vision starts here in Jamaica.

Indeed! The United States of America has the most advanced systems for stock trading but I think Jamaica has enough sophistication and history to start with a _viable market_ that can springboard into a globally influential product.

We can take inspiration from several products that are well-known globally that started in Jamaica. They include,

1. **Reggae Music**: Originating from Jamaica, reggae music has become popular worldwide, with artists like Bob Marley achieving international acclaim.

2. **Blue Mountain Coffee**: Grown in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica, this coffee is renowned for its high quality and distinct flavor profile, making it a sought-after commodity around the world.

3. **Jerk Seasoning**: Jamaican jerk seasoning is a spice blend famous for its bold and flavorful taste. It's used to season meats like chicken, pork, and fish, and has gained popularity worldwide.

4. **Rum**: Jamaica produces several notable rum brands, such as Appleton Estate and Wray & Nephew, which are enjoyed globally in cocktails and other drinks.

5. **Ackee**: This fruit is a staple in Jamaican cuisine and is often cooked with saltfish to make the traditional dish "ackee and saltfish." It has gained recognition internationally for its unique taste and culinary versatility.

6. **Dancehall Music**: Similar to reggae, dancehall music originated in Jamaica and has made waves globally, influencing various music genres and artists worldwide.

7. **Athletes**: Jamaica is renowned for producing world-class athletes, particularly in track and field. Sprinters like Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce have dominated the international stage and brought global recognition to Jamaica's athletic prowess.

8. **Ting**: Ting is a popular Jamaican grapefruit soda known for its refreshing taste. While primarily consumed in Jamaica, it has also gained a following in other countries, especially among fans of Caribbean cuisine.

Even **Chocolate Milk**, is thought to have been inspired by a European who visited Jamaica.[^4]

### The Mission

The mission is, 

_To empower stock investors globally by providing an immersive platform that offers a story-based approach to understanding the development and performance of businesses._

Shillings seeks to deliver structured information in a visually appealing way with succinct context to engage novice and experienced investors. An ***immersive platform*** is a platform that has an integrated social and learning experience.

Consumers are not satisfied with the manner in which information is presented by the Jamaica Stock Exchange. They want the most up-to-date information presented in a manner that is easy to understand.

### Brokerage Opportunity

Another important business idea for consideration is to start a brokerage firm, where this product will be used to access the services of the broker. According to Jamaican laws (the Securities Act[^2]),

> To be able to trade securities on the Trading Floor of the Exchange, a trading license is required. Only qualified and approved JSE broker-dealer firms may acquire and hold trading licenses. A company has to be approved as a member/dealer by the Board of the Jamaica Stock Exchange. Senior executives, shareholders and employees dealing with the public must pass a “ Fit and Proper” test and the firm has to meet certain basic financial requirements on an ongoing basis. Only approved representatives of stock broking firms are allowed to trade on the floor of the Jamaica Stock Exchange.[^5]

Individuals eligible for a dealer's licence includes the following,

1. he satisfies one of the following requirements, that is to say—

   > (i) he holds a degree in economics, accounting or business related subjects; or
   > 
   > (ii) has a professional qualification in law or accounting; or
   > 
   > (iii) has successfully completed a programme of study in securities approved by the Commission; and
 
2. has worked for at least two years in the securities industry; and
 
3. has a net worth of at least ten million dollars or has acquired indemnity insurance for at least that amount.

These are the requirements for starting a stock brokerage. If those requirements can be met, then that firm can use this as a way to position itself to members of the market that want a real-time digitized approach to the business of trading stocks.

The onboarding process to get prospective customers to trade stocks in the current framework of Jamaican brokerages appears to be tedious. The challenge with delivering a 10x tech disruption is to build the system so intuitive that stating all the steps to be onboarded is not necessary. All the affordances easily navigates the user to conduct their affairs without being stumped.

Setting up a brokerage in Jamaica also involves the following important requirements,

1. The JSE and the Financial Services Commission must register all employees of these firms who assist customers in making investment decisions and who trade on our market.

2. These JSE member-dealer organizations must meet rigorous regulatory standards. Firms are obliged to monitor their own compliance with applicable rules and regulations for possible violations. Each year, JSE RMOD (JSE's compliance department) examines every member organization that does business with the public to determine whether these requirements are met.

## Monetization

"The whales pay for the minnows". I think ultimately, the best monetization strategy is to,

1. Build customer base by offering analytical tools and trading free of cost. This will cost the business.

2. Once critical mass of customer base is arrived, companies listed on the stock exchange can be charged to better prepare their customer profile to appeal to investors. A subscription fee for seamless advertising. Offer a subscription for companies to have an enhanced profile, including additional multimedia content, promotional materials, and priority placement on your website.

3. After critical mass of businesses subscribing, customers who want special services can be charged. (Need to figure those special services: access to historical archives of company reports and other related history of listed companies)

Step 1 may take 4 to 5 years.

If this project leads into the setting up of a brokerage, then there will be an opportunity to earn from each trade made on the platform by getting brokerage fee as currently done on [JTrader Pro](./MARKETING/INDUSTRY/JM.md#jtrader-pro).

## The Market

The research done on the [market](./MARKETING/MARKET/) and the [industry](./MARKETING/INDUSTRY/) confirms that technology and communities around the world are actively developing in harmony with each other to deliver a pure digital experience to investors. Currently, some digital experience is not as efficient in some jurisdiction as it is in others. There's still heavy use of PDF documents as forms and manual approval systems used by staff members of brokerage firms (stock brokers). The brokers dependendency on their Government's infrastructure limits their ability to fully automate KYC responsibilities. The choice of funding stock trading accounts on trading platforms also requires manual approval though the brokers interact with software to do so. Even with some of the mentioned disharmony, there are still significant developments taking place by a number of fintech conglomerates. And, even though these conglomerates are closing gaps to provide a great digitized experience for investors, there is still room for improvement that startups can capitalize on.

![Minimum Viable Segment](/.attachments/minimum.viable.segment-4.png)

Six (6) minimum viable segments were identified that [this product can bring value](./MARKETING/VALUE.md). They include 4 types of investor profiles, the brokers and the listed companies.

### Pain Points

So, starting off with the [Jamaican market](./MARKETING/MARKET/JM.md) and the players in [that industry](./MARKETING/INDUSTRY/JM.md), the most common pain points for investors are,
1. Lack of real-time technical analysis
2. Disjointed information on stocks and associated companies

_Real-time technical analysis_ is vital to short-term investors because timely trades can preserve their gains and prevent losses. _Disjointed information_ can affect learning experience and exhaust even experienced investors. These pain points is all about the ease of gathering information to understand the companies and the stock market in a moment in time so that the best decision can be made.

The greatest pain point for the brokers is the lack of capital to automate the KYC and fund-in/fund-out requests for investors.

Listed companies always want to communicate to their investors in the best way possible.

### Budget

[Some investors](./MARKETING/MARKET/JM.md#interviews) are willing to pay as low as US$1 to as high as US$35 per month for the features mentioned in the [value proposition](./MARKETING/VALUE.md).

I think a subscription fee of US$7 per month for premium features is sweet spot to position ourselves for the kind of customers that we want to attract.

### Channel

As stated in the [marketing strategy](#strategy), the main channel will be outreach to the various communities, clubs and influencers that meet to discuss investment opportunities on the Jamaica Stock Exchange.

### Product Use Case

Usage scenarios are outlined in [value proposition](./MARKETING/VALUE.md).

### Customer Profile

Also referred to as buyer persona in [value proposition](./MARKETING/VALUE.md).

### Unique Selling Propositions

After examining the various communities and [tech solutions](./MARKETING/INDUSTRY/JM.md#competitors), the unique selling propositions that this product offers includes,
1. Integrated learning environment
2. Integrated social environment
   1. Rating systems: Expert's, Company's, Brokers
   2. Share ways to make gains
   3. Share forecasts
3. Visually immersive experience
4. News sentiment interpreter (bullish, bearish, neutral)
5. Interactive financial reports
   1. Hyperactive links to auditor's notes
   2. Shenanigan's notes
   3. Expert's notes
6. Buffet's performance checklist

_Integrated learning environment_ is built to engage and immerse the users into a progressive but contextual exposure of information. It's not taken for granted that terms, ticker symbols and numbers are understood by the user. Short snippets of information and _affordances_ are used to guide investors through the fundamental and technical material in a teacher-directed fashion.

_Integrated social environment_ contains features to facilitate the natural urge for us to share and learn from others.

_Visually immersive experience_ makes use of graphics to engage and explain information published by companies. This all depends on the graphical work published in the companies' annual reports.

_New sentiment interpreter_ is an automated tool that interprets news articles as bullish, bearish or neutral for certain industries and companies.

_Interactive financial reports_ makes use of the rich interactive experience that can be provided in a web page. PDF documents provided by companies that are difficult to navigate will be rerendered to provide this experience. An experience that includes expert's notes and comments, including identifying financial shenanigan's.

_Buffet's performance checklist_ is a scorecard of the company to which the stock is associated. It scores a company on its _durable competitive advantage_.

The unique selling propositions will be delivered according to our [UX design philosophy](./EXPERIENCE/).

### Marketing Strategy

The strategy to bring awareness to the product involves practicing the philosophy of using the _smallest viable market_ to develop the product while in its infancy stage (beta phase). The members chosen for the _smallest viable market_ will include about 7 investors that are described in the 4 different buyer personas explained in the [value proposition](./MARKETING/VALUE.md#investors). These members are expected to be part of a wider social network of investors to which they will share their experience. It's pretty much a grassroots approach.

As the word spreads, members will be brought on-board through a referral registration system, where the system provides a token to the prospect. For future reference, members can be rewarded and incentivized to expand membership. The initial membership will allow access but not trading, since trading will require KYC requirements of each new prospect.

In addition to this approach, we will reach out to [communities and influencers in the industry](./MARKETING/INDUSTRY/JM.md#communities-and-thought-leaders) to deliver a branded presentation. A _branded presentation_ involves the use of logos, catchy name and slogans to conduct a live presentation of the product.

Advertisements will not be necessary until there's significant traction and renown of the product. Advertisements will not be used to bring awareness but to state the claim that the product is the leader of its category in the market.

SEO strategy will be considered after 2,000 members ar actively using the product or a decision is made to enter into the US market.

### Sales Approach

If we do arrive at a freemium model, the referral model will be used to engage the sales. It is a far less aggressive approach.

A business-to-business sales model maybe considered, where listed companies pay to organize their profiles and promote their stock to investors.

Both sales and monetization is not fully decided.

### Brand Awareness

The [brand philosophy](./BRANDING/) that will be embraced is one that places ***Shillings*** as the first of its kind in a new category. ***Shillings*** so far is the first story-based trading platform that provides an immersive experience that engages young people from the age of 18 up to participate more in the stock market. Any avatar, logo, slogan and color theme that projects fortune and vibrance are brand statements that we plan to use. As it relates to the name, we can rebrand ***Shillings*** to use the Google model, where a new word is created but a word that has at most 2 syllables. If the word has to have "stocks" in it, then we can stretch the name to accommodate 3 syllables, at most.

## Finance and Operations

The financial projections and overall operations of this business can be found within this section.

### Corporate Structure

- ? Inc. is the corporation established to manage the stock brokerage firm that owns Shillings.

### Key Management Personnel

- Dayton Outar: CEO
- ?: Chief Financial Officer
- ?: Director

![Shillings Business Canvas](/.attachments/shillings.business.canvas-2.png)

### Financing Strategy

The _Shillings_ project will be conservative on the use of debt to finance it's initial _research and development_. It will initially be financed through a combination of strategies including the use of: 
- personal savings and funds from founders
- sweat equity, 
- strategic partnerships and 
- revenue generation.

This approach reduces reliance on external financing and preserves equity. We plan to encourage team members to invest their time and skills in exchange for equity rather than immediate compensation. This aligns incentives and conserves cash for essential expenses.

### Operational Strategy

We embrace a lean approach to operations, minimizing unnecessary expenses and overhead costs. This includes negotiating favorable terms with suppliers, using cost-effective marketing channels, and optimizing resource allocation.

Currently, the labour for _Research and Development_ is the highest cost in the initial stage. Since the founder is an engineer, he will use his time and skill to complete the foundational milestones (an initial _epic_). In addition, marketing research will be done by him.

A group of seven (7) persons will be asked to volunteer their time to test the product after the completion of these milestones. Those seven (7) persons will be provided an equity stake based on the value of their labour, which will be outlined in the budget. The completion of this test phase can be referred to as _Beta V_.

It is while promoting the product, after _Beta V_, that consideration will be given to borrowing funds to conduct marketing campaigns in the various investment communities and clubs islandwide.

In the second phase of this project, financing a tech team will be considered. The idea is to employ a tech team using [the Hollywood approach](./BRANDING/THE.BRAND.GAP.md#hooray-for-hollywood), where best talent is contracted for each _epic_ (a chosen list of features from the backlog). This means that embarking on a new _epic_ can be costly and should be carefully planned. This removes the need to employ tech team permanently. This will be done until the company can afford to hire employees permanently.

### Key Points:
- The expenses remain consistent across Year 2 and Year 3, while revenue grows as premium subscriptions increase.
- Despite revenue increases, the company is still running at a loss in both years.

The **OpenAI API usage** was estimated at **$500 per month** based on the assumption that the company would be making moderate to frequent use of the API to deliver LLM services to users on the website. Here's how it was calculated:

1. **API Call Volume**: The company might anticipate regular API calls for delivering LLM services to its users. This could depend on:
   - Number of users using the service (e.g., 30 users in Year 1, 50 in Year 2, 100 in Year 3).
   - Frequency and complexity of interactions (e.g., chat, content generation, or other features leveraging LLM).

2. **OpenAI Pricing Structure**: The OpenAI API charges based on the **number of tokens processed** (input + output). The exact cost depends on the specific model used (e.g., GPT-4 or GPT-3.5). For reference:
   - GPT-4 8k context: $0.03/1k tokens (prompt), $0.06/1k tokens (completion).
   - GPT-3.5: $0.0015/1k tokens (prompt), $0.002/1k tokens (completion).

3. **Usage Estimate**:
   - For moderate usage, assuming each user generates **10,000 tokens per month** (roughly 10-20 medium-length interactions per user):
   - **50 users** in Year 2 × **10,000 tokens** = 500,000 tokens per month.
   - At $0.03 per 1,000 tokens, the cost is **$15/month** for prompts.
   - At $0.06 per 1,000 tokens, the cost is **$30/month** for completions.
   - This gives **$45/month** per 50 users for moderate interaction.
   
4. **Additional Scaling**: To account for unpredictable scaling or more intensive use of the LLM (e.g., larger responses, more frequent queries), I scaled the estimate to **$500/month**.

If only a **system user** is making the queries to the OpenAI API (for example, storing information in a database for later retrieval by regular and premium users), the API usage will be significantly lower. The following steps can be used to estimate the new monthly cost:

### Key Factors
- **System User**: Only a single system user makes the queries (not all users).
- **Frequency of Queries**: The system user might perform queries when necessary, for example, to generate content, summaries, or responses that can be stored and used by multiple users.
- **Usage Volume**: This reduces the frequency and volume of API calls, as multiple users benefit from a single query made by the system.

### Recalculation Assumptions:
1. **Query Frequency**: Let’s assume the system makes **50 API queries** per month.
2. **Tokens per Query**: Each query might use **2,000 tokens** (input + output).
3. **OpenAI Pricing** (for **GPT-4 8k** context):
   - **$0.03/1,000 tokens** for input (prompt).
   - **$0.06/1,000 tokens** for output (completion).

### Calculation:
- **Total tokens per query**: 2,000 tokens/query.
- **Cost per query**:
  - **Prompt tokens**: 1,000 tokens × $0.03 = $0.03.
  - **Completion tokens**: 1,000 tokens × $0.06 = $0.06.
  - **Total cost per query** = $0.09.

- **Total monthly cost**:
  - 50 queries/month × $0.09/query = **$4.50/month**.

### Adjustments for Larger Queries:
If some queries are more complex and use **5,000 tokens** (for example), the monthly cost might increase:
- **Cost per query**:
  - 2,500 prompt tokens × $0.03 = $0.075.
  - 2,500 completion tokens × $0.06 = $0.15.
  - **Total cost per query** = $0.225.
- **Total monthly cost** for 50 queries:
  - 50 queries × $0.225 = **$11.25/month**.

---

### Summary of OpenAI API Cost

- For **2,000 tokens/query**: **$4.50/month**.
- For **5,000 tokens/query**: **$11.25/month**.

With this new calculation, the OpenAI API cost is much lower, ranging from **$4.50 to $11.25 per month**, depending on query complexity and token usage.
