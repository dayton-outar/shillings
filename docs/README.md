# Business Design Philosophy

***Shillings*** is the first story-based securities trading platform. Its goal is to create an immersive learning experience for tracking and trading securities.

There's a story behind all the numbers and symbols. There's a story behind how the companies listed were formed. There's a story of the impact each listed company is making regionally and globally. There's a story behind how well each company is performing.

## Value Proposition

***Shillings*** caters to,

1. Investors

   Value Proposition:
    - Fully digitized trading platform integrated with insights (financial analysis) and training
       - Ease of access to analysis of stock prices and company performance (technical and fundamental analysis)
       - An integrated learning experience. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) course outlines, quizzes and videos comes to mind.
       - Make use of visual media as much as possible. Make less use of written content. Less reading more visual appeal.

2. Brokers
   
   Value Proposition:
    - Ease of on-boarding new investors
    - Ease of tracking and trading securities. Showing and allowing communication between broker and investor at each stage of trading.
  
3. Listed Companies

   Value Proposition:
    - Deliver reports with the similar experience as an annual report via their company profile. Shifting from PDF to visually interactive media experience.
    - Engage investors to purchase their stocks

Apart from providing analysis on companies, this project seeks to enable customers to purchase and sell stocks via a chosen stock broker online. This project adds value by offering the convenience to conduct business this without submitting anything physical or go into any office in person.

## Purpose

Why did I build Shillings?

1. I wanted to better understand the market response to a stock over a span of 10 years to get an idea of the risk and possibilities. This was technical analysis. Getting the history over that period of time was not easily visualized by the Jamaica Stock Exchange.

2. I wanted to compare fundamental ratios like profit margin and liquidity but no easy way of doing this was offered on the Jamaica Stock Exchange. This was done for the US Stock Exchange on the Google Finance website (also Yahoo Finance). Reports were not consolidated into one central place.

3. Basic company profile was not offered by the Jamaica Stock Exchange. Value investors need to know the story of each company. There's more to a Stock Exchange than the stock prices. The company's listed are usually the main contributors to an economy and offer goods and services within the local and global marketplace.

Shillings seeks to deliver structured information by making use of visualization tools. Information will be provided in a visually appealing way that engages novice investors to learn as they invest.


Differentiation: How will it solve that problem or pain point better than the current solutions?

Value: How will it make our business and users' lives better?

### Monetization

"The whales pay for the minnows". I think ultimately, the best monetization strategy is to,

1. Build customer base by offering analytical tools and trading free of cost. This will cost the business.

2. Once critical mass of customer base is arrived, companies listed on the stock exchange can be charged to better prepare their customer profile to appeal to investors. A subscription fee for seamless advertising. Offer a subscription for companies to have an enhanced profile, including additional multimedia content, promotional materials, and priority placement on your website.

3. After critical mass of businesses subscribing, customers who want special services can be charged. (Need to figure those special services: access to historical archives of company reports and other related history of listed companies)

Step 1 may take 4 to 5 years.

    - P/E ratio
    - BUY and SELL orders
    - Dividend Yield
    - Dividend Policy. Liquidity of companies in IPO report. 
    - Connections between companies in shareholder list (for example Barita owns shares in Derrimon Trading) and the stock price of related parties that are listed. Look out for pension fund companies in shareholder list.

   US$10 per month
  
**BONUS:** If intrinsic valuation is done, it's a good idea to show a breakdown of how the numbers were arrived.
