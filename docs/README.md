# Business Design Philosophy

***Shillings*** is the first story-based stock trading platform. Its goal is to reach the global stock trading market by bringing an immersive experience for tracking and trading securities.

Publicly listed companies and their investors have their stories surrounding the drama of its development and performance. Companies attempt to tell these stories in the quarterly and annual reports. _Shillings_ brings a different perspective of how to interpret ticker symbols and numbers to increase the participation rate in the various stock exchanges around the world.

## The Problem

Jamaica's increased exposure to technology creates a need for persons to do most things online.

Online experience offered by Jamaica Stock Exchange is disjointed[^1]

What is the 5-minute story of how the business makes the customer a hero?

## Value Proposition

***Shillings*** caters to 3 major players of the stock market,
1. Investors
2. Brokers
3. Publicly Listed Companies

Brokers are the intermediaries needed to ensure investors abide by regulations, while the stock exchange focuses on settling trades. They are not the drivers in this industry. If _Shillings_ becomes a broker, the main focus will be on the investors and the publicly listed companies.

#### Tracy Trader, The Swing Income Trader

Tracy Trader is described as the Swing Income Trader because she seeks to generate a steady stream of income from dividend-paying stocks but also is interested in the capital gains from stocks that increase in value. She swings from stock to stock for every opportunity to earn income despite the fees charged for this practice. She is indeed a short-term investor that is entertained and committed to the stock market more than the long-term investor.

#### Ingrid Investor, The Long-term Investor

Ingrid Investor is a long-term investor that cannot be bothered to check up on the daily ups and downs of the market. She is more focused on the long-term returns that her investment in a particular stock will yield. Some of Ingrid's peers prefer to have a mutual fund manage their funds until they "mature" for them when they retire. Ingrid is just a little bit more adventurous and open to learning the stock market.

#### Knows Nothing, Novices

Knows Nothing is a novice to the stock market but he is fascinated with the excitement from hearing persons that make gains from trading stocks. He wants to learn but there are so many terms, symbols, figures and combination of chart patterns that intimidate him. He took a look at Investopedia.com but doesn't even know where to start learning. The volume of information to cover is overwhelming. Knows Nothing needs a guide and a plan to get through the difficult learning curve.

### Brokers
   
- Ease of on-boarding new investors
- Ease of tracking and trading fund-in and fund-out request. Showing and allowing communication between broker and investor at each stage of trading.
  
### Listed Companies

- Deliver reports with the similar experience as an annual report via their company profile. Shifting from PDF to visually interactive media experience.
- Engage investors to purchase their stocks

Apart from providing analysis on companies, this project seeks to enable customers to purchase and sell stocks via a chosen stock broker online. This project adds value by offering the convenience to conduct business this without submitting anything physical or go into any office in person.

## Purpose

Why did I build Shillings?

1. I wanted to better understand the market response to a stock over a span of 10 years to get an idea of the risk and possibilities. This was technical analysis. Getting the history over that period of time was not easily visualized by the Jamaica Stock Exchange.

2. I wanted to compare fundamental ratios like profit margin and liquidity but no easy way of doing this was offered on the Jamaica Stock Exchange. This was done for the US Stock Exchange on the Google Finance website (also Yahoo Finance). Reports were not consolidated into one central place.

3. Basic company profile was not offered by the Jamaica Stock Exchange. Value investors need to know the story of each company. There's more to a Stock Exchange than the stock prices. The company's listed are usually the main contributors to an economy and offer goods and services within the local and global marketplace.

Shillings seeks to deliver structured information by making use of visualization tools. Information will be provided in a visually appealing way that engages novice investors to learn as they invest.

Consumers are not satisfied with the manner in which information is presented by the Jamaica Stock Exchange and they want the most up-to-date information presented in a manner that makes it easier for their decision making (without having to do too much to organize the information).

Differentiation: How will it solve that problem or pain point better than the current solutions?

Value: How will it make our business and users' lives better?

Another important business idea for consideration is to start a brokerage firm, where this product will be used to access the services of the broker. According to Jamaican laws (the Securities Act[^2]),

> an individual is eligible to apply for a dealer’s licence or an investor adviser’s licence if—
> 
> (a) he satisfies one of the following requirements, that is to say—
> 
>     (i) he holds a degree in economics, accounting or business related subjects; or
> 
>     (ii) has a professional qualification in law or accounting; or
> 
>     (iii) has successfully completed a programme of study in securities approved by the Commission; and
> 
> (b) has worked for at least two years in the securities industry; and
> 
> (c) has a net worth of at least ten million dollars or has acquired indemnity insurance for at least that amount.

The law continues to state,

> A company is eligible to apply for a dealer’s licence if it maintains capital of at least fifty million dollars.

> A company is eligible to apply for an investment adviser’s licence if it maintains free assets of at least one million dollars.

These are the requirements for starting a stock brokerage. If those requirements can be met, then that firm can use this as a way to position itself to members of the market that want a real-time digitized approach to the business of trading stocks.

## Monetization

"The whales pay for the minnows". I think ultimately, the best monetization strategy is to,

1. Build customer base by offering analytical tools and trading free of cost. This will cost the business.

2. Once critical mass of customer base is arrived, companies listed on the stock exchange can be charged to better prepare their customer profile to appeal to investors. A subscription fee for seamless advertising. Offer a subscription for companies to have an enhanced profile, including additional multimedia content, promotional materials, and priority placement on your website.

3. After critical mass of businesses subscribing, customers who want special services can be charged. (Need to figure those special services: access to historical archives of company reports and other related history of listed companies)

Step 1 may take 4 to 5 years.
