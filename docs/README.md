![Domain Authority by Tier](/.attachments/domain-authority-by-tier.png)

> What’s a good score? It depends. But a good DA is a HIGH DA.
>
> However, it depends on how long the domain and your business have existed. To give you a quick sense, websites that have been around a very long time, like Google and Apple, will have a high DA (95+).
>
> Conversely, startups with a new website will probably be near 10-20. It’s easier to move the needle when it’s lower than trying to move from 70 to 80 plus. On average, Domain Authority of 50 and above is good, with 60-70 very good and above 80 excellent.
>
> Domain Authority builds over time. It is based on a scale that measures the likelihood of a website ranking on Google’s SERP. Today it is still considered one of the many metrics executives, heads of marketing, and SEO professionals should pay attention to. But when looking and analyzing, the playing field should be equal. Compare your site and DA to those of similar value.[^1]
