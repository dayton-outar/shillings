# Notes from The Brand Gap

## Introduction

> To manage a brand is to manage something much less tangible—an aura, an invisible layer of meaning that surrounds the product.

> A brand is a _person’s gut feeling_ about a product, service, or company. It’s a GUT FEELING because we’re all emotional, intuitive beings, despite our best efforts to be rational. It’s a PERSON’S gut feeling, because in the end the brand is defined by individuals, not by companies, markets, or the so-called general public. Each person creates his or her own version of it. While companies can’t control this process, they can influence it by communicating the qualities that make this product different than that product. When enough individuals arrive at the same gut feeling, a company can be said to have a brand. In other words, a brand is not what YOU say it is. It’s what THEY say it is. A brand is a kind of Platonic ideal—a concept shared by society to identify a specific class of things.

> A brand, like Plato’s horse, is an approximate—yet distinct—understanding of a product, service, or company. To compare a brand with its competitors, we only need to know what makes it different. Brand management is the management of differences, not as they exist on data sheets, but as they exist in the minds of people.

> Today we base our choices more on symbolic attributes. What does the product look like? Where is it being sold? What kind of people buy it? Which “tribe” will I be joining if I buy it? What does the cost say about its desirability? What are other people saying about it? And finally, who makes it? Because if I can trust the maker, I can buy it now and worry about it later. The degree of trust I feel towards the product, rather than an assessment of its features and benefits, will determine whether I’ll buy this product or that product.

> Trust creation is a fundamental goal of brand design.

What can our brand be trusted to deliver to our customers?

> If a company’s brand value is such a large part of its assets, why isn’t it listed on the balance sheet? Good question. But while companies ponder this, they’re already using brand values as tools to obtain financing, put a price on licensing deals, evaluate mergers and acquisitions, assess damages in litigation cases, and justify the price of their stock.

> A charismatic brand can be defined as any product, service, or company for which people believe there’s no substitute. Not surprisingly, charismatic brands often claim the dominant position in their categories, with market shares of 50% or higher. They also tend to command the highest price premiums—up to 40% more than generic products or services. And, most importantly, they’re the least likely to fall victim to commoditization.

Commoditization refers to the process by which goods, services, or even ideas become increasingly standardized, widely available, and interchangeable in the eyes of consumers. As a result of this process, products or services that were once unique or differentiated can lose their distinctiveness and may be perceived as interchangeable with similar offerings from competitors.

Commoditization often leads to intense price competition, as there is little perceived differentiation among the available options. This can result in reduced profit margins for businesses and a focus on cost-cutting measures (a race to the bottom). The term is commonly used in business and economics to describe a situation where products or services that were once considered premium or specialized become more commonplace and affordable, thus losing some of their unique value.

For example, in the technology industry, many electronic components and devices have gone through a process of commoditization as manufacturing processes become more efficient and competition increases. As a result, what was once cutting-edge technology may eventually become a standard, widely available product with lower profit margins.

Commoditization can have both positive and negative effects. On one hand, it can lead to increased affordability and accessibility for consumers. On the other hand, it can pose challenges for businesses that rely on differentiation to command premium prices and maintain healthy profit margins.

> Among the hallmarks of a charismatic brand are a clear competitive stance, a sense of rectitude, and a dedication to aesthetics. Why aesthetics? Because it’s the language of feeling, and, in a society that’s information-rich and time-poor, people value feeling more than information.

> Aesthetics is so powerful that it can turn a commodity into a premium product. Don’t believe me? Look at Morton. Ordinary table salt is the ultimate commodity—unless it has a little girl on the package.

The five disciplines of branding are,
 1. Differentiate
 2. Collaborate
 3. Innovate
 4. Validate
 5. Cultivate

## Differentiate

The three little questions,
 1. Who are you?
 2. What do you do?
 3. Why does it matter?

These questions attempts to get into the deeper reasons that customers choose a product (see "This is Marketing" by Seth Godin).

> Unless you have compelling answers to all three questions, meaning that customers find them irresistible, you haven’t got a brand.

> Clorox is a company that understands differentiation. When Clorox purchased Hidden Valley ranch dressing, their marketing people had the good sense not to add it to their product line and rename it Clorox Hidden Valley. In fact, the name Clorox has never appeared on any of Hidden Valley’s packages, advertisements, or other marketing materials. Yet you’d be surprised at how many companies have violated common sense and paid the price. The lesson? Keep it pure, keep it different.

### The Evolution of Marketing

> As we’ve moved from a one-size-fits-all economy to a mass-customization economy, the attention of marketing has shifted from features, to benefits, to experience, to tribal identification. In other words, selling has evolved from an emphasis on “what it has,” to “what it does,” to “what you’ll feel,” to “who you are.” This shift demonstrates that, while features and benefits are still important to people, personal identity has become even more important.

> The success of the Nike brand is ample proof that de Bono’s concept works. As a weekend athlete, my two nagging doubts are that I might be congenitally lazy, and that I might have little actual ability. I’m not really worried about my shoes. But when the Nike folks say, “Just do it,” they’re peering into my soul. I begin to feel that, if they understand me that well, their shoes are probably pretty good. I’m then willing to join the tribe of Nike.

### Globalism vs. Tribalism

> We’ve heard a lot of talk about globalism—the knocking down of national, economic, and cultural barriers to create a single society. In the 1960s Marshall McLuhan envisioned a world so connected by technology that the old divisions would disappear, made obsolete by a massive “global village.” Forty years later we have no global village, and we probably never will, at least in the usual sense of a village—an intimate community united by a single language and culture. Instead we have a global communication network, an electronic layer on top of the old divisions that influences them and adds to them, but doesn’t replace them.
>
> The fact is, we need divisions just as much as we need ways to transcend them. Without barriers there would be no safety—against war, disease, natural disaster, a feeling of alienation, of being lost in an uncaring world. The faster globalism removes barriers, the faster people erect new ones. They create intimate worlds they can understand, and where they can be somebody and feel as if they belong. They create tribes.
>
> If you stretch the concept of tribe just a little, you can see that a brand creates a kind of tribe. Depending on your Unique Buying State, you can join any number of tribes on any number of days and feel part of something bigger than yourself. You can belong to the Callaway tribe when you play golf, the VW tribe when you drive to work, and the Williams-Sonoma tribe when you cook a meal. You’re part of a select clan (or so you feel) when you buy products from these clearly differentiated companies. Brands are the little gods of modern life, each ruling a different need, activity, mood, or situation. Yet you’re in control. If your latest god falls from Olympus, you can switch to another one.

### Focus, Focus, Focus

> Yet focus is difficult to achieve because it means giving something up. It runs counter to our most basic marketing instinct: If we narrow our offering, won’t we narrow our opportunities for profit? Answer: Not necessarily. It’s often better to be number one in a small category than to be number three in a large one. At number three your strategy may have to include a low price, whereas at number one you can charge a premium. History has shown that it pays handsomely to be number one in your category—first, because of higher margins, and second, because the risk of commoditization is almost nonexistent. Yet number two can also be profitable, despite a smaller market share. Number three, or four, or five, however, may only be worth the effort if you think you have a realistic shot at becoming number two someday.
>
> Can’t be number one or number two? Redefine your category. The industrial-strength software product Framemaker only made it to number three as a word-processing product, but as a document-publishing product it quickly became number one, with double its previous sales. All it took was a change of focus.
>
> ...
> Brand extensions make less sense when they’re driven by a desire for short-term profits without regard to focus. What makes them especially seductive is that they can work remarkably well in the short term, even as they undermine the position of the brand. A recent example of defocusing by brand extension is the Cayenne, an SUV from Porsche. In a single misguided stroke, Porsche has pulled the rug out from under its reputation as a maker of classic sports cars. They maintain that the Cayenne is an example of Porsche innovation, but Porsche fans will say it’s a grab for profits in a tired market. Had Porsche invented the SUV, people might see it as innovation, but at the tail-end of the trend it looks more like greed—especially since Porsche is already highly profitable. Naturally, the new car will sell. It’s got the revered Porsche styling, engineering, and pedigree, all of which can be harvested through line extension. But the question is, what does Porsche now stand for?

> Even in the best of times, the principle of focus is a hard mistress, demanding fidelity, courage, and determination. And when a company faces additional pressure from stockholder expectations, political infighting, unexpected competition, or changes in management, there’s a temptation to extend the product line for short-term relief, even at the expense of its market position. Resist, because the long-term survival of a brand depends on staying focused. As positioning expert Jack Trout succinctly puts it, “differentiate or die.”

## Collaborate

> Management guru Peter Drucker maintains that the most important shift in business today is from “ownership” to “partnership,” and from “individual tasks” to “collaboration.” The successful company is not the one with the most brains, he suggests, but the most brains acting in concert. Brand managers and communication firms are responding to this new challenge in a number of interesting ways.

> The third model, the integrated marketing team, bears little resemblance to the traditional out-sourcing model. It sees branding as a continuous network activity that needs to be controlled from within the company. In this model, best-of-breed specialist firms are selected to work alongside internal marketing people on a virtual “superteam,” which is then “coached” by the company’s design manager. The advantages of this model are the ability to unify a message across media, the freedom to work with best-of-breed specialists, plus internal stewardship. This last benefit is important, because it means that brand knowledge can accrue to the company, instead of vanishing through a revolving door with the last firm to work on it. A drawback of an integrated marketing team is that it requires a strong internal team to run it.
