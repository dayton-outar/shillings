# Notes from The Brand Gap

## Introduction

> To manage a brand is to manage something much less tangible—an aura, an invisible layer of meaning that surrounds the product.

> A brand is a _person’s gut feeling_ about a product, service, or company. It’s a GUT FEELING because we’re all emotional, intuitive beings, despite our best efforts to be rational. It’s a PERSON’S gut feeling, because in the end the brand is defined by individuals, not by companies, markets, or the so-called general public. Each person creates his or her own version of it. While companies can’t control this process, they can influence it by communicating the qualities that make this product different than that product. When enough individuals arrive at the same gut feeling, a company can be said to have a brand. In other words, a brand is not what YOU say it is. It’s what THEY say it is. A brand is a kind of Platonic ideal—a concept shared by society to identify a specific class of things.

> A brand, like Plato’s horse, is an approximate—yet distinct—understanding of a product, service, or company. To compare a brand with its competitors, we only need to know what makes it different. Brand management is the management of differences, not as they exist on data sheets, but as they exist in the minds of people.

> Today we base our choices more on symbolic attributes. What does the product look like? Where is it being sold? What kind of people buy it? Which “tribe” will I be joining if I buy it? What does the cost say about its desirability? What are other people saying about it? And finally, who makes it? Because if I can trust the maker, I can buy it now and worry about it later. The degree of trust I feel towards the product, rather than an assessment of its features and benefits, will determine whether I’ll buy this product or that product.

What can our brand be trusted to deliver to our customers?

> If a company’s brand value is such a large part of its assets, why isn’t it listed on the balance sheet? Good question. But while companies ponder this, they’re already using brand values as tools to obtain financing, put a price on licensing deals, evaluate mergers and acquisitions, assess damages in litigation cases, and justify the price of their stock.

> A charismatic brand can be defined as any product, service, or company for which people believe there’s no substitute. Not surprisingly, charismatic brands often claim the dominant position in their categories, with market shares of 50% or higher. They also tend to command the highest price premiums—up to 40% more than generic products or services. And, most importantly, they’re the least likely to fall victim to commoditization.

Commoditization refers to the process by which goods, services, or even ideas become increasingly standardized, widely available, and interchangeable in the eyes of consumers. As a result of this process, products or services that were once unique or differentiated can lose their distinctiveness and may be perceived as interchangeable with similar offerings from competitors.

Commoditization often leads to intense price competition, as there is little perceived differentiation among the available options. This can result in reduced profit margins for businesses and a focus on cost-cutting measures (a race to the bottom). The term is commonly used in business and economics to describe a situation where products or services that were once considered premium or specialized become more commonplace and affordable, thus losing some of their unique value.

For example, in the technology industry, many electronic components and devices have gone through a process of commoditization as manufacturing processes become more efficient and competition increases. As a result, what was once cutting-edge technology may eventually become a standard, widely available product with lower profit margins.

Commoditization can have both positive and negative effects. On one hand, it can lead to increased affordability and accessibility for consumers. On the other hand, it can pose challenges for businesses that rely on differentiation to command premium prices and maintain healthy profit margins.

> Among the hallmarks of a charismatic brand are a clear competitive stance, a sense of rectitude, and a dedication to aesthetics. Why aesthetics? Because it’s the language of feeling, and, in a society that’s information-rich and time-poor, people value feeling more than information.

> Aesthetics is so powerful that it can turn a commodity into a premium product. Don’t believe me? Look at Morton. Ordinary table salt is the ultimate commodity—unless it has a little girl on the package.

The five disciplines of branding are,
 1. Differentiate
 2. Collaborate
 3. Innovate
 4. Validate
 5. Cultivate

## Differentiate

The three little questions,
 1. Who are you?
 2. What do you do?
 3. Why does it matter?

These questions attempts to get into the deeper reasons that customers choose a product (see "This is Marketing" by Seth Godin).

> Unless you have compelling answers to all three questions, meaning that customers find them irresistible, you haven’t got a brand.
