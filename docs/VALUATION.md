# Valuation Models Used

## Valuing Stocks

There are 2 main approaches to valuation,

1. Discounted Cash Flow Model
2. Relative Valuation

### Discounted Cash Flow Model

The value of any asset following the present value rule is, 

$$\huge{Value = \sum_{t=1}^{t=n}{CF_{t} \over (1 + r)^t}}$$

where,

<blockquote>
<p>n = Life of the asset</p>
<p>CF<sub>t</sub> = Cash flow in period t</p>
<p>r = Discount rate reflecting the riskiness of the estimated cash flows</p>
</blockquote>

Cash flow can be determined from 2 main sources for stocks: dividends and free cash flow. Some of the mathematical approaches to evaluation of a stock includes,

1. Dividend-Discount Model
2. Free Cash Flow to Equity Model
3. Free Cash Flow to Firm Model

If the company that issued stocks on a stock market pays dividends, a version of the Discounted Cash Flow Model referred to as the _Dividend-Discount Model_ can be applied to arrive at the net present value of the stock.

The equation below applies to a single N-year investor, who will collect dividends for N years and
then sell the stock, or to a series of investors who hold the stock for shorter periods and
then resell it.<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>

$$\huge{P_0 = {Div_1 \over 1 + r_E} + {Div_2 \over (1 + r_E)^2} + {Div_3 \over (1 + r_E)^3} + \ldots + {Div_N \over (1 + r_E)^N} + { P_N \over (1 + r_E)^N } }$$

For the special case in which the firm eventually
pays dividends and is never acquired, it is possible to hold the shares forever.<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>

$$\huge{P_0 = {Div_1 \over 1 + r_E} + {Div_2 \over (1 + r_E)^2} + {Div_3 \over (1 + r_E)^3} + \ldots = \sum_{n=1}^\infty {Div_n \over (1 + r_E)^n} }$$

The main ingredients needed to arrive at the value of a company includes,

1. Financial Statements
   
   3 main statements are required: Income-Expense, Balance Sheet and Cashflow Statement

2. Stock Prices
3. Stock Indices
4. Interest Rates of Jurisdiction

    These rates are described as the risk-free rate


$$\huge{Enterprise Value in Year T = V_T^L = { FCF_{T + 1} \over r_{wacc} - g } }$$
