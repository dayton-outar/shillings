## Warren Buffet's Interpretation of Financial Statements

### Income Statements

1. Gross Profit Margin
    > margins _[consistently]_ below 20% is a good indicator of a fiercely competitive market
2. Depreciation against Gross Profits (dividing Depreciation by Gross Profit)
    > companies with a percentage depreciation lower than 8% tend to have a durable competitive advantage
3. Earnings per Stock Unit
    > a consistent upward trend is a good sign

### Balance Sheet

1. Quick Ratio
    > companies with surplus of cash have a durable competitive advantage
2. Inventory Turnover
    > manufacturing companies with inventories that ramp up stock in one year and ramp down the next year is showing signs of being in a highly competitive market
3. Receivables Turnover
    > companies consistently showing lower ratio of recievables compared to their competitors has a higher competitive advantage
4. Return on Assets
    > high ROA may indicate vulnerability of the company and, hence, vulnerability of durable competitive advantage
5. Total Assets
    > high total asset can present high barrier to entry [for other prospective competitors to enter]
6. Long-term vs Short-term Debt
    > Buffet shied away from companies that are bigger borrowers of short-term money [rather] than long-term money. He preferred Wells-Fargo $0.57 of short-term debt to every dollar or long-term debt than to Bank of America $2.09 of short-term debt to every dollar of long-term debt.
7. Debt-to-Equity
    > companies with durable competitive advantage often carry little or no long-term debt
    > sometimes this can be skewed to make a great company look mediocre ***due to stock buybacks***
8. Return on Equity
    > high ROE will add up and increase the underlying value of the company

### Cash Flow

1. Treasury Stock Units
    > presence of treasury shares is a hallmark of a company with durable competitive advantage
2. Preferred Stock Units
    > companies with durable competitive advantage tend not have preferred shares


## Financial Reporting Shenanigans

These are the classification of shenanigans that can be undertaken by companies when they report their stewardship of the company.


### Earnings Manipulation

1. Recording revenue too soon
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Recording revenue before completing material obligations under the contract

      > ... pushed customers to sign contracts just before quarter-end, believing that the signing of a contract was the key event to permit recording revenue.

      > ... revenues should be recognized when earned, not at the point of signing a contract

      > ... the company began to recognize some revenue earlier in the sales process &mdash; at the point of shipment, rather than delivery.

   2. Recording revenue far in excess of work completed on the contract
      
      > ... [recording] revenue in a far greater amount than is warranted

      > Specifically, Ulvac [a company] had just changed its revenue recognition approach to percentage-of-completion (POC), and as a result, it began booking sales much earlier than it would with its traditional approach. ... Ulvac provides an illustration of the dramatic jump in reported revenue when a company switches from standard revenue recognition practices to the more aggressive POC approach.

      > Investors should be extra vigilant when _analyzing_ companies using percentage-of-completion accounting, since the reported results hinge on the company's estimates about its own progress.

      > Investors shold use a measure called "days' sales outstanding" (DSO)[^1] to evaluate how quickly customers are paying their bills relative to how quickly revenue is recorded. A higher DSO could indicate more aggressive revenue recognition in addition to simply poor cash management.

      We could say that ***recording revenue before completing material obligations*** and ***recording revenue far in excess of work completed*** are generally the same thing but the subtle difference is that this technique (_recording in excess of work completed_) is legitimized through a POC policy. Basically both techniques involves recognizing revenue before completion of delivery of the product or service offered by the company (or business).

   3. Recording revenue before the buyer's final acceptance of the product

   4. Recording revenue when the buyer's payment remains uncertain or unnecessary

2. Recording bogus revenue
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Recording revenue from transactions that lack economic substance
      
      > In these transactions, the so-called customer is either under no obligation to keep or pay for the product, or no product or service was even traferred in the first place.

      > Brightpoint proceeded to record the $15 million "insurance recovery" as income in the December quarter (which netted out its unreported losses). AIG recorded what amounted to bogus revenue on the insurance premiums over the next three years. Economic sense dictates that this transaction was not an insurance contract because no real risk had been transferred. Indeed, the transaction was nothing more than a financing arrangement: Brightpoint deposited cash at AIG, which AIG eventually refunded as purported "insurance claim payments."

      > As we have learned, ***a rapid increase in accounts receivable is often an indication of deteriorating financial health***

      > .... [a company] not only sold products to a distributor but later repurchased from that same distributor unwanted, unused, or overpriced products, initiating a "round-trip" cash payment that would come back to Autonomy [another company]. According to the SEC, this scheme alon inflated Autonomy's reported revenue by nearly $200 million between 2009 and 2011.

   2. Recording revenue from transactions that lack a resonable arm's-length process
      
      > ... staggering revenue growth came from a 10-fold increase in sales to a suspicious related party. The sales accounted for nearly half of Syntax-Billian's total revenue, and the related party was an Asian distributor named South China House of Technology (SCHOT). Syntax-Brillian's relationship with SCHOT was much more incestuous than a typical customer-supplier arragement. The two companies seemed to be involved in a tangled web of joint ventures (which also, oddly, included Syntax-Brillian's primary supplier). Syntax-Brillian was close enough with SCHOT that it granted it 120-day payment terms and routinely extended those terms even further. .... Then suddenly, in February 2008, Syntax-Brillian cryptically announced that the Olympic facilities would no longer be installing the TVs that the company had "sold" to South China House of Technology. Even though Syntax-Brillian had already recorded revenue from the sale of these TVs, it agreed to "repurchase" more than 25,000 TVs for nearly $100 million. The company did not need to come up with the cash because the receivable from SCHOT was, of course, still outstanding. With this significant right or return and no receipt of cash, Syntax-Brillian should never have recognized this revenue in the first place!

   3. Recording revenue on receipts from non-revenue-producing transactions
      
      > Apparently, auto parts manufacturer Delphi Corporation failed to understand the distinction between a liability and revenue. In late December 2000, Delphi took out a $200 million short-term loan, posting inventory as collateral. Rather than recording the cash received as a liability that needed to be paid back, Delphi improperly recorded it as the sale of goods &mdash; as if the inventory posted as collateral had been purchased by the bank.

      > When purchasing goods from a vendor, cash normally flows in one direction &mdash; from the customer to the vendor. Sometimes, cash will flow in the opposite direction, usually in the form of a volume rebate or refund. Booking these cash rebates as revenue would clearly be inappropriate, as they should be considered an adjustment to the cost of inventory purchased. However, the creative folks at Sunbeam did not see it that way. Sunbeam played a neat trick to boost revenue in which it advanced cash to vendors and then recorded revenue when that cash was repaid. Additionally, Sunbeam would commit to future purchases from a particular vendor in exchange for an immediate "rebate" from that vendor, which Sunbeam, or course, recorded as revenue.

  4. Recording revenue from inappropriate transactions, but at inflated amounts

     > ... by booking as sales the gross amount its members paid for a deal, without deducting the sizable portion it owed to the merchants. In the restated registration documents, the SEC mandated that Groupon change from the "gross" to "net" method, causing revenue to melt down from almost $1.6 billion to only $688 million, a decline of 57 percent during the six months ended June 2011.

3. Boosting income using one-time or unsustainable activities
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Boosting income using one-time events

      > ... IBM booked a $4.1 billion gain from selling its Global Network business to AT&T and curiously included that gain as a _reduction in the SG&A [Selling, general and administrative] expense._

   2. Boosting income through misleading classifications
      
      > While treating interest income as revenue clearly would be appropriate for banks and other financial institutions, it certainly sounds a bit unusual for a restaurant.

      > Companies can produce misleadingly strong revenue and operating income growth simply by benefiting from one of the quirks of consolidation accounting. Let's look at the accounting if a company decided to form several majority-owned joint ventures, owning 60 percent of each. Accounting rules require that the units be consolidated and that the "parent" report all the revenue and operating expenses as operating income (that is, above the line) as if were its own; the 40 percent owned by others would be subtracted later on the Income Statement (below the line).

4. Shifting current expenses to a later period
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Excessively capitalizing normal operating expenses

      > ... improperly [recording] costs on the Balance Sheet as an asset (or "capitalizing" the costs), instead of expensing them immediately.
        ... assets [fall] into two categories: (1) those that are expected to produce a future benefit (e.g. inventory, equipment, and prepaid insurance) and (2) those that are ultimately expected to be exchanged for another asset such as cash (e.g., receivables and investments).
      > ...
      > 
      > **Warning Signs of Improperly Capitalizing Normal Operating Expenses**
      >
      >  - Unwarranted improvements in profit margins and a large jump in certain assets
      >  - A big unexpected decline in free cash flow, with an equally sizable increase in cash flow from operations
      >  - Unexpected increases in capital expenditures that belie the company's original guidance and market conditions

      > Facing pressure from investors to continue its 11-quarter streak of out-performance, CFO Steven Neil orchestrated a scheme in which the company would pay the walnut growers to make them whole for the 2009 crop, but they would call the payment an "advance" on the next year's crop. This sleight of hand gave Neil the justificaion he needed to capitalize these payments on the Balance Sheet, rather than expense them in the current year. Despite this sneaky trick, the walnut growers knew that this payment was not really an advance on the 2010 crop; rather it related to the already-delivered 2009 crop.

   2. Amortizing costs too slowly

      > A company that chooses an overly long depreciation or amortization period generally would be considered guilty of using aggressive accounting. A more serious offence, however, is a company's _changing to a longer period_. This often suggests that the company's business may be in trouble and that it feels compelled to change accounting assumptions to camouflage the deterioration.

   3. Failing to write down assets with impaired value
      
      > ... consider a piece of equipment that management first assumed would last for 10 years but that breaks down permanently during year 5. Once it's out of service, the original depreciation schedule should be abandoned, and the remaining asset balance must be oved to the Expense section immediately. If the company instead chooses to continue depreciating the asset according to the original 10-year plan, it will have failed to write down an appropriately capitalized cost that had later become impaired.

      > ... DSI [Days' Sales of Inventory][^1] standardizes the inventory balance relative to inventory sold (i.e., cost of good sold) in a period. This calculation helps investors determine whether an increase in the absolute level of inventory is in line with the overall growth of the business or whether it might be a harbinger of margin pressure.

      > An additional measure can be used to test whether an inventory buildup might be justified by upcoming demand: simply compare the growth in the absolute level of inventory with the company's expected revenue growth. If inventory growth far exceeds the expected sales growth, the inventory bulge is probably unwarranted and a concern for investors.

   4. Failing to record expenses for uncollectible receivables and devalued investments
      
      > ... companies can inflate earnings by failing to turn assets into expenses when a clear loss in value has occurred.

      > ... companies cannot just close their eyes and pray that all their receivables will eventually be collected.

      > Companies must routinely adjust their accounts receivable balance to reflect expected customer defaults. This entails recording an expense on the Income Statement ("bad debts expense") and a reduction of accounts receivable on the Balance Sheet (the "allowance for doubtful accounts," which offsets gross receivables). Failing to record sufficient bad debts expense, or inappropriately reversing past bad debts expense, creates artificial profits.

5. Employing techniques to hide expenses or losses
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Failing to record an expense at the appropriate amount from a current transaction
      
      > ... aims to lower the period's total expenses by failing to record an actual obligation giving rise to an expense (like rent).

      > ... Symbol [a company] paid bonuses to employees in the March 2000 quarter but failed to record the related obligation to pay $3.5 million in Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) insurance.

      > Tell a supplier that you will agree to purchase $9 million of office products and that you will pay an inflated price od $10 million. In exchange for this large order, you ask the supplier to pay you a $1 million up-front "rebate" upon signing the agreement. You then improperly record the rebate as an immediate reduction of your office expenses. By using this trick, you have boosted earnings by the $1 millon receipt, which should have been recorded as a reduction of the inflated price of future office supplies purchases.

   2. Recording inappropriately low expenses by using aggresive accounting assumptions
      
      > In 2012, Deere [a company] estimated that the residual value of its rental equipment would aount to 55 percent of the initial value, leaving 45 percent of the initial cost to be depreciated. However, in each subsequent year, this estimate increases, reaching 63 percent in 2015. By increasing the estimate, the company would now be depreciating only 37 percent (down from 45 percent) of the initial value. Because of this subtle change in estimate of the residual value, Deere materially lowered its depreciation expense and artificially boosted its gross margin and operating income.

      > Just a simple change in the month designated as the measurement date for the pension plan can inflate profits. For example, in 2004, Raytheon Co. changed the date on whic it measured its pension plan from October 31 to December 31. This simple change provided a $41 million ($0.09 bump to earnings per share) bottom-line boost, which accounted for about 10 percent of Raytheon's earnings for the entire year.

   3. Reducing expenses by releasing reserves from previous charges
      
      > Reserves come in different shapes and sizes and can be found all over the Balance Sheet. ... reserves [can be] recorded on the Balance Sheet as offsets to assets, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, the allowance for loan losses, and inventory obsolescence reserves. ... While accrual accounting reuires companies to create a reserve for costs incurred but not yet expended (such as warranties), these reserves can easily be abused to manipulate earnings.

6. Shifting current income to a later period

   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Creating reserves and releasing them into income in a later period
      
      > When business is booming and earnings far exceed Wall Street estimates, companies may be tempted not to report all their revenue, but instead to save some of it for a rainy day. ... storing it [earnings] on the Balance Sheet until it is needed during a later period.

   2. Smoothing income by improperly accounting for derivatives
      
      > Companies with healthy businesses can engage in income-smoothing shenanigans to give the illusion of nice, steady, predictable results. Consider mortgage giant Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac, or Freddie) and its desire to portray very smooth earnings despite a period of volative interest rate movements. Freddie's attempts to smooth earnings went to the extreme and led to a $5 billon fraud.

   3. Creating reserves in conjunction with an acqusition and releasing them into income in a later period

      > ... acquisitive companies create some of the biggest challenges for investors. ... combined companies immediately become more difficult to analyze on an apples-to-apples basis. ... acquisition accounting rules create distortions in the presentation of cash flow from operations. ... companies making acquisitions might be tempted to have the target company hold back some revenue that was earned before the deal closes so that the acquirer can record it in the later period.

   4. Recording current-period sales in a later period
      
      > ... it is unlikely that the auditors will even know about this trick, and your customers certainly won't object since they will get billed later than they expected. ... it portrays higher sales in the later period.

7. Shifting future expenses to the current period
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Improperly writing off assets in the current period to avoid expenses in a future period
      
      > ... AOL had accumulated more than $314 million in the asset account labeled "deferred membership acquisition costs" (DMAC). But the company still had a big problem: those costs represented tomorrow's expense, and they would need to be amortized over the next eight quarters&mdash;a $40 million hit to earnings each quarter. ... AOL switched gears by announcing "a one-time charge" to write off the entire amount in one fell swoop. ... it had to come up with a justification to convince the auditors that this asset account had suddenly become "impaired" and would provide no future benefit. So AOL claimed that the write-off was necessary to reflect changes in its evolving business model, including rediced reliance on subscribers' fees as the company developed other revenue source.

      > ... NVIDIA writing off inventory that it did not throw away

   2. Improperly recording charges to establish reserves used to reduce future expenses

      > ... company that is taking a restructuring charge (such as laying off workers) might consider padding the total dollars written off to lower future-period operating expenses. Thus, salary expense to employees who are laid off today will decline in future periods, as any future severance payments received will be bundled into today's one-time charge. The result: future periods' above-the-line operating expense disappears, and the current period's below-the-line restructuring charge increases by that same amount.

### Cash Flow Shenanigans

> ... high net income along with low CFFO (Cash Flow from Operations) often signals the presence of some **Earnings Manipulation Shenanigans**

1. Shifting Financing cash inflows to the Operating section
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Recording bogus CFFO (Cash Flow from Operations) from a normal bank borrowing

   2. Boosting CFFO by selling receivables before the collection date

   3. Inflating CFFO by faking the sale of receivables

2. Moving cash outflows from the Operating section to other sections
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Inflating CFFO with boomerang transactions

   2. Improperly capitalizing normal operating costs

   3. Recording the purchase of inventory as an investing outflow

   4. Shifting operating cash outflows off the Statement of Cash Flows

3. Boosting operating cash flow using unsustainable activities
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Boosting CFFO by paying vendors more slowly

   2. Boosting CFFO by collecting from customers more quickly

   3. Boosting CFFO by purchasing less inventory

   4. Boosting CFFO with one-time benefits

### Key Metrics Shenanigans

1. Showcasing misleading metrics that overstate performance
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Highlighting a misleading metric as a surrogate for revenue

   2. Highlighting a misleading metric as a surrogate for earnings

   3. Highlighting a misleading metric as a surrogate for cash flow

2. Distorting Balance Sheet metrics to avoid showing deterioration
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Distorting accounts receivable metrics to hide revenue problems

   2. Distorting inventory metrics to hide profitability problems

   3. Distorting financial asset metrics to hide impairment problems

   4. Distorting debt metrics to hide liquidity problems

### Acquisition Accounting Shenanigans

1. Artificially boosting revenue and earnings
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Inflating profits through tricks at a target company before a deal closes

   2. Inflating profits by hiding losses at deal closing

   3. Creating dubious new revenue streams after closing

   4. Inflating profits by releasing suspicious reserves either before or just after closing

2. Inflating reported cash flow
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Inheriting operating inflows in a normal business acquisition

   2. Acquiring contracts or customers rather than developing them internally

   3. Boosting CFFO by creatively structuring the sale of a business

3. Manipulating key metrics
