## Warren Buffet's Interpretation of Financial Statements

### Income Statements

1. Gross Profit Margin
    > margins _[consisitently]_ below 20% is a good indicator of a fiercely competitive market
2. Depreciation against Gross Profits (dividing Depreciation by Gross Profit)
    > companies with a percentage depreciation lower than 8% tend to have a durable competitive advantage
3. Earnings per Stock Unit
    > a consistent upward trend is a good sign

### Balance Sheet

1. Quick Ratio
    > companies with surplus of cash have a durable competitive advantage
2. Inventory Turnover
    > manufacturing companies with inventories that ramp up stock in one year and ramp down the next year is showing signs of being in a highly competitive market
3. Receivables Turnover
    > companies consistently showing lower ratio of recievables compared to their competitors has a higher competitive advantage
4. Return on Assets
    > high ROA may indicate vulnerability of the company and, hence, vulnerability of durable competitive advantage
5. Total Assets
    > high total asset can present high barrier to entry [for other prospective competitors to enter]
6. Long-term vs Short-term Debt
    > Buffet shied away from companies that are bigger borrowers of short-term money [rather] than long-term money. He preferred Wells-Fargo $0.57 of short-term debt to every dollar or long-term debt than to Bank of America $2.09 of short-term debt to every dollar of long-term debt.
7. Debt-to-Equity
    > companies with durable competitive advantage often carry little or no long-term debt
    > sometimes this can be skewed to make a great company look mediocre ***due to stock buybacks***
8. Return on Equity
    > high ROE will add up and increase the underlying value of the company

### Cash Flow

1. Treasury Stock Units
    > presence of treasury shares is a hallmark of a company with durable competitive advantage
2. Preferred Stock Units
    > companies with durable competitive advantage tend not have preferred shares


## Financial Reporting Shenanigans

These are the classification of shenanigans that can be undertaken by companies when they report their stewardship of the company.


### Earnings Manipulation

1. Recording revenue too soon
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Recording revenue before completing material obligations under the contract

      > ... pushed customers to sign contracts just before quarter-end, believing that the signing of a contract was the key event to permit recording revenue.

      > ... revenues should be recognized when earned, not at the point of signing a contract

      > ... the company began to recognize some revenue earlier in the sales process &mdash; at the point of shipment, rather than delivery.

   2. Recording revenue far in excess of work completed on the contract

   3. Recording revenue before the buyer's final acceptance of the product

   4. Recording revenue when the buyer's payment remains uncertain or unnecessary

2. Recording bogus revenue
3. Boosting income using one-time or unsustainable activities
4. Shifting current expenses to a later period
5. Employing techniques to hide expenses or losses
6. Shifting current income to a later period
7. Shifting future expenses to the current period

### Cash Flow Shenanigans

1. Shifting Financing cash inflows to the Operating section
2. Moving cash outflows from the Operating section to other sections
3. Boosting operating cash flow using unsustainable activities

### Key Metrics Shenanigans

1. Showcasing misleading metrics that overstate performance
2. Distorting Balance Sheet metrics to avoid showing deterioration

### Acquisition Accounting Shenanigans

1. Artificially boosting revenue and earnings
2. Inflating reported cash flow
3. Manipulating key metrics
