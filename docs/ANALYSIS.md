## Warren Buffet's Interpretation of Financial Statements

### Income Statements

1. Gross Profit Margin
    > margins _[consistently]_ below 20% is a good indicator of a fiercely competitive market
2. Depreciation against Gross Profits (dividing Depreciation by Gross Profit)
    > companies with a percentage depreciation lower than 8% tend to have a durable competitive advantage
3. Earnings per Stock Unit
    > a consistent upward trend is a good sign

### Balance Sheet

1. Quick Ratio
    > companies with surplus of cash have a durable competitive advantage
2. Inventory Turnover
    > manufacturing companies with inventories that ramp up stock in one year and ramp down the next year is showing signs of being in a highly competitive market
3. Receivables Turnover
    > companies consistently showing lower ratio of recievables compared to their competitors has a higher competitive advantage
4. Return on Assets
    > high ROA may indicate vulnerability of the company and, hence, vulnerability of durable competitive advantage
5. Total Assets
    > high total asset can present high barrier to entry [for other prospective competitors to enter]
6. Long-term vs Short-term Debt
    > Buffet shied away from companies that are bigger borrowers of short-term money [rather] than long-term money. He preferred Wells-Fargo $0.57 of short-term debt to every dollar or long-term debt than to Bank of America $2.09 of short-term debt to every dollar of long-term debt.
7. Debt-to-Equity
    > companies with durable competitive advantage often carry little or no long-term debt
    > sometimes this can be skewed to make a great company look mediocre ***due to stock buybacks***
8. Return on Equity
    > high ROE will add up and increase the underlying value of the company

### Cash Flow

1. Treasury Stock Units
    > presence of treasury shares is a hallmark of a company with durable competitive advantage
2. Preferred Stock Units
    > companies with durable competitive advantage tend not have preferred shares


## Financial Reporting Shenanigans

These are the classification of shenanigans that can be undertaken by companies when they report their stewardship of the company.


### Earnings Manipulation

1. Recording revenue too soon
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Recording revenue before completing material obligations under the contract

      > ... pushed customers to sign contracts just before quarter-end, believing that the signing of a contract was the key event to permit recording revenue.

      > ... revenues should be recognized when earned, not at the point of signing a contract

      > ... the company began to recognize some revenue earlier in the sales process &mdash; at the point of shipment, rather than delivery.

   2. Recording revenue far in excess of work completed on the contract
      
      > ... [recording] revenue in a far greater amount than is warranted

      > Specifically, Ulvac [a company] had just changed its revenue recognition approach to percentage-of-completion (POC), and as a result, it began booking sales much earlier than it would with its traditional approach. ... Ulvac provides an illustration of the dramatic jump in reported revenue when a company switches from standard revenue recognition practices to the more aggressive POC approach.

      > Investors should be extra vigilant when _analyzing_ companies using percentage-of-completion accounting, since the reported results hinge on the company's estimates about its own progress.

      > Investors shold use a measure called "days' sales outstanding" (DSO)[^1] to evaluate how quickly customers are paying their bills relative to how quickly revenue is recorded. A higher DSO could indicate more aggressive revenue recognition in addition to simply poor cash management.

      We could say that ***recording revenue before completing material obligations*** and ***recording revenue far in excess of work completed*** are generally the same thing but the subtle difference is that this technique (_recording in excess of work completed_) is legitimized through a POC policy. Basically both techniques involves recognizing revenue before completion of delivery of the product or service offered by the company (or business).

   3. Recording revenue before the buyer's final acceptance of the product

   4. Recording revenue when the buyer's payment remains uncertain or unnecessary

2. Recording bogus revenue
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Recording revenue from transactions that lack economic substance
      
      > In these transactions, the so-called customer is either under no obligation to keep or pay for the product, or no product or service was even traferred in the first place.

      > Brightpoint proceeded to record the $15 million "insurance recovery" as income in the December quarter (which netted out its unreported losses). AIG recorded what amounted to bogus revenue on the insurance premiums over the next three years. Economic sense dictates that this transaction was not an insurance contract because no real risk had been transferred. Indeed, the transaction was nothing more than a financing arrangement: Brightpoint deposited cash at AIG, which AIG eventually refunded as purported "insurance claim payments."

      > As we have learned, ***a rapid increase in accounts receivable is often an indication of deteriorating financial health***

      > .... [a company] not only sold products to a distributor but later repurchased from that same distributor unwanted, unused, or overpriced products, initiating a "round-trip" cash payment that would come back to Autonomy [another company]. According to the SEC, this scheme alon inflated Autonomy's reported revenue by nearly $200 million between 2009 and 2011.

   2. Recording revenue from transactions that lack a resonable arm's-length process
      
      > ... staggering revenue growth came from a 10-fold increase in sales to a suspicious related party. The sales accounted for nearly half of Syntax-Billian's total revenue, and the related party was an Asian distributor named South China House of Technology (SCHOT). Syntax-Brillian's relationship with SCHOT was much more incestuous than a typical customer-supplier arragement. The two companies seemed to be involved in a tangled web of joint ventures (which also, oddly, included Syntax-Brillian's primary supplier). Syntax-Brillian was close enough with SCHOT that it granted it 120-day payment terms and routinely extended those terms even further. .... Then suddenly, in February 2008, Syntax-Brillian cryptically announced that the Olympic facilities would no longer be installing the TVs that the company had "sold" to South China House of Technology. Even though Syntax-Brillian had already recorded revenue from the sale of these TVs, it agreed to "repurchase" more than 25,000 TVs for nearly $100 million. The company did not need to come up with the cash because the receivable from SCHOT was, of course, still outstanding. With this significant right or return and no receipt of cash, Syntax-Brillian should never have recognized this revenue in the first place!

   3. Recording revenue on receipts from non-revenue-producing transactions
      
      > Apparently, auto parts manufacturer Delphi Corporation failed to understand the distinction between a liability and revenue. In late December 2000, Delphi took out a $200 million short-term loan, posting inventory as collateral. Rather than recording the cash received as a liability that needed to be paid back, Delphi improperly recorded it as the sale of goods &mdash; as if the inventory posted as collateral had been purchased by the bank.

      > When purchasing goods from a vendor, cash normally flows in one direction &mdash; from the customer to the vendor. Sometimes, cash will flow in the opposite direction, usually in the form of a volume rebate or refund. Booking these cash rebates as revenue would clearly be inappropriate, as they should be considered an adjustment to the cost of inventory purchased. However, the creative folks at Sunbeam did not see it that way. Sunbeam played a neat trick to boost revenue in which it advanced cash to vendors and then recorded revenue when that cash was repaid. Additionally, Sunbeam would commit to future purchases from a particular vendor in exchange for an immediate "rebate" from that vendor, which Sunbeam, or course, recorded as revenue.

  4. Recording revenue from inappropriate transactions, but at inflated amounts

     > ... by booking as sales the gross amount its members paid for a deal, without deducting the sizable portion it owed to the merchants. In the restated registration documents, the SEC mandated that Groupon change from the "gross" to "net" method, causing revenue to melt down from almost $1.6 billion to only $688 million, a decline of 57 percent during the six months ended June 2011.

3. Boosting income using one-time or unsustainable activities
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Boosting income using one-time events

      > ... IBM booked a $4.1 billion gain from selling its Global Network business to AT&T and curiously included that gain as a _reduction in the SG&A [Selling, general and administrative] expense._

   2. Boosting income through misleading classifications
      
      > While treating interest income as revenue clearly would be appropriate for banks and other financial institutions, it certainly sounds a bit unusual for a restaurant.

      > Companies can produce misleadingly strong revenue and operating income growth simply by benefiting from one of the quirks of consolidation accounting. Let's look at the accounting if a company decided to form several majority-owned joint ventures, owning 60 percent of each. Accounting rules require that the units be consolidated and that the "parent" report all the revenue and operating expenses as operating income (that is, above the line) as if were its own; the 40 percent owned by others would be subtracted later on the Income Statement (below the line).

4. Shifting current expenses to a later period
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Excessively capitalizing normal operating expenses

      > ... improperly [recording] costs on the Balance Sheet as an asset (or "capitalizing" the costs), instead of expensing them immediately.
        ... assets [fall] into two categories: (1) those that are expected to produce a future benefit (e.g. inventory, equipment, and prepaid insurance) and (2) those that are ultimately expected to be exchanged for another asset such as cash (e.g., receivables and investments).
      > ...
      > 
      > **Warning Signs of Improperly Capitalizing Normal Operating Expenses**
      >
      >  - Unwarranted improvements in profit margins and a large jump in certain assets
      >  - A big unexpected decline in free cash flow, with an equally sizable increase in cash flow from operations
      >  - Unexpected increases in capital expenditures that belie the company's original guidance and market conditions

      > Facing pressure from investors to continue its 11-quarter streak of out-performance, CFO Steven Neil orchestrated a scheme in which the company would pay the walnut growers to make them whole for the 2009 crop, but they would call the payment an "advance" on the next year's crop. This sleight of hand gave Neil the justificaion he needed to capitalize these payments on the Balance Sheet, rather than expense them in the current year. Despite this sneaky trick, the walnut growers knew that this payment was not really an advance on the 2010 crop; rather it related to the already-delivered 2009 crop.

   2. Amortizing costs too slowly

      > A company that chooses an overly long depreciation or amortization period generally would be considered guilty of using aggressive accounting. A more serious offence, however, is a company's _changing to a longer period_. This often suggests that the company's business may be in trouble and that it feels compelled to change accounting assumptions to camouflage the deterioration.

   3. Failing to write down assets with impaired value
      
      > ... consider a piece of equipment that management first assumed would last for 10 years but that breaks down permanently during year 5. Once it's out of service, the original depreciation schedule should be abandoned, and the remaining asset balance must be oved to the Expense section immediately. If the company instead chooses to continue depreciating the asset according to the original 10-year plan, it will have failed to write down an appropriately capitalized cost that had later become impaired.

      > ... DSI [Days' Sales of Inventory][^1] standardizes the inventory balance relative to inventory sold (i.e., cost of good sold) in a period. This calculation helps investors determine whether an increase in the absolute level of inventory is in line with the overall growth of the business or whether it might be a harbinger of margin pressure.

      > An additional measure can be used to test whether an inventory buildup might be justified by upcoming demand: simply compare the growth in the absolute level of inventory with the company's expected revenue growth. If inventory growth far exceeds the expected sales growth, the inventory bulge is probably unwarranted and a concern for investors.

   4. Failing to record expenses for uncollectible receivables and devalued investments
      
      > ... companies can inflate earnings by failing to turn assets into expenses when a clear loss in value has occurred.

      > ... companies cannot just close their eyes and pray that all their receivables will eventually be collected.

      > Companies must routinely adjust their accounts receivable balance to reflect expected customer defaults. This entails recording an expense on the Income Statement ("bad debts expense") and a reduction of accounts receivable on the Balance Sheet (the "allowance for doubtful accounts," which offsets gross receivables). Failing to record sufficient bad debts expense, or inappropriately reversing past bad debts expense, creates artificial profits.

5. Employing techniques to hide expenses or losses
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Failing to record an expense at the appropriate amount from a current transaction
      
      > ... aims to lower the period's total expenses by failing to record an actual obligation giving rise to an expense (like rent).

      > ... Symbol [a company] paid bonuses to employees in the March 2000 quarter but failed to record the related obligation to pay $3.5 million in Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) insurance.

      > Tell a supplier that you will agree to purchase $9 million of office products and that you will pay an inflated price od $10 million. In exchange for this large order, you ask the supplier to pay you a $1 million up-front "rebate" upon signing the agreement. You then improperly record the rebate as an immediate reduction of your office expenses. By using this trick, you have boosted earnings by the $1 millon receipt, which should have been recorded as a reduction of the inflated price of future office supplies purchases.

   2. Recording inappropriately low expenses by using aggresive accounting assumptions
      
      > In 2012, Deere [a company] estimated that the residual value of its rental equipment would aount to 55 percent of the initial value, leaving 45 percent of the initial cost to be depreciated. However, in each subsequent year, this estimate increases, reaching 63 percent in 2015. By increasing the estimate, the company would now be depreciating only 37 percent (down from 45 percent) of the initial value. Because of this subtle change in estimate of the residual value, Deere materially lowered its depreciation expense and artificially boosted its gross margin and operating income.

      > Just a simple change in the month designated as the measurement date for the pension plan can inflate profits. For example, in 2004, Raytheon Co. changed the date on whic it measured its pension plan from October 31 to December 31. This simple change provided a $41 million ($0.09 bump to earnings per share) bottom-line boost, which accounted for about 10 percent of Raytheon's earnings for the entire year.

   3. Reducing expenses by releasing reserves from previous charges
      
      > Reserves come in different shapes and sizes and can be found all over the Balance Sheet. ... reserves [can be] recorded on the Balance Sheet as offsets to assets, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, the allowance for loan losses, and inventory obsolescence reserves. ... While accrual accounting reuires companies to create a reserve for costs incurred but not yet expended (such as warranties), these reserves can easily be abused to manipulate earnings.

6. Shifting current income to a later period

   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Creating reserves and releasing them into income in a later period
      
      > When business is booming and earnings far exceed Wall Street estimates, companies may be tempted not to report all their revenue, but instead to save some of it for a rainy day. ... storing it [earnings] on the Balance Sheet until it is needed during a later period.

   2. Smoothing income by improperly accounting for derivatives
      
      > Companies with healthy businesses can engage in income-smoothing shenanigans to give the illusion of nice, steady, predictable results. Consider mortgage giant Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac, or Freddie) and its desire to portray very smooth earnings despite a period of volative interest rate movements. Freddie's attempts to smooth earnings went to the extreme and led to a $5 billon fraud.

   3. Creating reserves in conjunction with an acqusition and releasing them into income in a later period

      > ... acquisitive companies create some of the biggest challenges for investors. ... combined companies immediately become more difficult to analyze on an apples-to-apples basis. ... acquisition accounting rules create distortions in the presentation of cash flow from operations. ... companies making acquisitions might be tempted to have the target company hold back some revenue that was earned before the deal closes so that the acquirer can record it in the later period.

   4. Recording current-period sales in a later period
      
      > ... it is unlikely that the auditors will even know about this trick, and your customers certainly won't object since they will get billed later than they expected. ... it portrays higher sales in the later period.

7. Shifting future expenses to the current period
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Improperly writing off assets in the current period to avoid expenses in a future period
      
      > ... AOL had accumulated more than $314 million in the asset account labeled "deferred membership acquisition costs" (DMAC). But the company still had a big problem: those costs represented tomorrow's expense, and they would need to be amortized over the next eight quarters&mdash;a $40 million hit to earnings each quarter. ... AOL switched gears by announcing "a one-time charge" to write off the entire amount in one fell swoop. ... it had to come up with a justification to convince the auditors that this asset account had suddenly become "impaired" and would provide no future benefit. So AOL claimed that the write-off was necessary to reflect changes in its evolving business model, including rediced reliance on subscribers' fees as the company developed other revenue source.

      > ... NVIDIA writing off inventory that it did not throw away

   2. Improperly recording charges to establish reserves used to reduce future expenses

      > ... company that is taking a restructuring charge (such as laying off workers) might consider padding the total dollars written off to lower future-period operating expenses. Thus, salary expense to employees who are laid off today will decline in future periods, as any future severance payments received will be bundled into today's one-time charge. The result: future periods' above-the-line operating expense disappears, and the current period's below-the-line restructuring charge increases by that same amount.

### Cash Flow Shenanigans

> ... high net income along with low CFFO (Cash Flow from Operations) often signals the presence of some **Earnings Manipulation Shenanigans**

1. Shifting Financing cash inflows to the Operating section
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Recording bogus CFFO (Cash Flow from Operations) from a normal bank borrowing

      > Delphi went to its bank (Bank One) and offered to sell it $200 million in precious metals inventory. Not surprisingly, Bank One had no interest in buying inventory. Remember, we are talking about a bank, not an auto parts manufacturer. Delphi understood this and crafted the agreement in such a way that Bank One would be able to "sell" the inventory back to Delphi a few weeks later (after year-end). In exchange for the bank's "ownership" of the inventory for a few weeks, Delphi would buy it back at a small premium to the original sale price.
      >
      > ...
      >
      > Delphi should have recorded the $200 million received from Bank One as a borrowing (an increase in cash flow from financing activities).
      >
      > ...
      >
      > Delphi brazenly recorded it as the sale of $200 million in inventory [placing it under cash flow from operating activities]. In so doing, Delphi inflated revenue and earnings ...


   2. Boosting CFFO by selling receivables before the collection date
      
      > In 2004, pharmaceutical distributor Cardinal Health needed to generate a lot more cash. So management decided to sell accounts receivable to help the company raise cash very quickly. By the end of the second quarter (December 2004), Cardinal Health had sold $800 million in customer receivables. This transaction was the primary driver of the company's robust $971 million in CFFO growth in December 2004 over the prior-year period.

   3. Inflating CFFO by faking the sale of receivables
      
      > ... Peregrine [a company] transferred its receivables to a bank in exchange for cash; however, the risk of collection loss remained with Peregrine. That collection risk was huge, of course, because _there were no customers_&mdash;many of the related risk of loss had not been transferred, Peregrine remained on the hook to return the cash to the bank when the receivables inevitably were not collected.
      > 
      > Since the receivables had never actually been transferred, the economics of this transaction would be more akin to a collaterized loan, .... Peregrine borrowed money from the bank and used receivables as collateral. On the Statement of Cash Flows, this should be presented as a _Financing_ inflow. Peregrine, however, ignored the economic reality of the situation. Instead, it recorded the transaction as the sale of receivables and shamelessly reported the cash received as an _Operating_ inflow.

2. Moving cash outflows from the Operating section to other sections
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Inflating CFFO with boomerang transactions
      
      > Global Crossing sold large blocks of future network capacity to telecom customers. At the same time, the company purchased a similar dollar amount of capacity from these same customers. In other words, Global Crossing would sell capacity to a customer and _simultaneously buy a similar amount of capacity_ on a different network. This was a classic _boomerang_ transaction. You can almost picture some Global Crossing executive telling the company's customers, "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours."
      >
      > So what does this have to do with cash flow? Well, Global Crossing recorded these boomerang transactions in a way that artificially inflated CFFO. The company recorded the cash that it received from its customers in these transactions as an Operating inflow; however, the cash that it paid to the same customers was recorded as an Investing outflow. Essentially, Global Crossing inflated cash flow from operating activities by depressing cash flow from investing activities.

   2. Improperly capitalizing normal operating costs
      
      > Recording normal operating costs as an asset rather than as an expense sounds simple, and frankly, it is quite easy to do. However, it is one of the scariest and most lethal shenanigans out there. Why? Because it is a simple sleight of hand that does more than just embellish earnings&mdash;it inflates operating cash flow as well.
      >
      > ... By classifying billions of dollars of normal operating costs as capital equipment purchases, WorldCom not only artificially inflated its profits, but it also overstated its CFFO.

   3. Recording the purchase of inventory as an investing outflow
      
      > The economics of purchasing goods to be sold to customers suggests that these purchases should be classified as an operating activity on the Statement of Cash Flows. Normally, this would be the case. Curiously, some companies treat these purchases as an Investing ourflow.
      >
      > ...
      > 
      > While Netflix's Income Statement appropriately reflected the economics of its DVD costs, its Statement of Cash Flows did not. You would think that the purchase of DVDs would have been presented on the SCF as an operating outflow just like the purchase of any inventory particularly the purchase of the new releases that were amortized for only one year). However, Netflix did not see it that way. Instead, it considered the purchase of DVDs to be the purchase of a capital asset, and therefore the cash outflows were presented in the Investing section. This treatment effectively moved a big cash outflow (payment for DVDs) from the Operating to the investing section, thereby inflating CFFO.

   4. Shifting operating cash outflows off the Statement of Cash Flows
      
      > Most companies with an employee pension plan fund those plans with cash that is invested to grow and meet the company's projected long-term obligations. These contributions have the unfortunate effect of reducing reported cash flows. What if pensions could be funded without depleting precious cash flow?
      >
      > In 2011, Diageo (maker of spirits including Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Guinness) funded its U.K. pension scheme with GBP535 million of whiskey. As the whiskey ages, its value would increase, improving the funded status of the plan. All the while, reported cash flows remain unaffected.

3. Boosting operating cash flow using unsustainable activities
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Boosting CFFO by paying vendors more slowly
      
      > Want to save a little more cash this year? Use your "delay-payments" lifeline: wait until the beginning of January to pay your December bills. If you push your payments out a month, your end-of-year bank balance will be higher, and it will cosmetically seem as if you generated more cash this year.

   2. Boosting CFFO by collecting from customers more quickly
      
      > For high-end electric automaker Tesla Motors, liquidity and cash flow have been particularly important metrics for investors and lenders. Since its found in 2003, Tesla had never posted a full year of positive free cash flow, and therefore the company had become entirely reliant on debt financing and equity issuances to continue funding its operations. In 2016, Tesla's operating cash outflows appeared to have improved, amounting to net outflows of $124 million, down from outflows of $524 million in 2015. However, what changed most significantly in terms of cash flow that year was that the company _began accepting orders and refundable customer deposits_ for its Model 3 sedan, which had been introduced only in concept. These deposits accounted for $350 million of additional inflows, or 88 percent of the reported improvement in 2016. Skeptical investors would have noted that fundamentally the business continued to burn cash at historical rates, but because of a successful marketing campaign, it was able to "borrow" from future periods and accelerate customer payments to report better results.

   3. Boosting CFFO by purchasing less inventory
      
      > Home Depot lowered its inventory levels simply by not restocking shelves after goods had been sold. In other words, the company just did not purchase as much inventory from vendors as in previous years.
      >
      > ... a company choosing to purchase less inventory would also provide an artificial and unsustainable boost to CFFO.

   4. Boosting CFFO with one-time benefits
      
      > ... Sun Microsystems, pocketed nearly $2 billion from Microsoft in 2004 ($1.6 billion of which was immediately recognized as income). Sun presented this large one-time item in plain view on its Statement of Operations, listing it separately as "settlement income." Sun's disclosure made it very easy for investors to understand that the income from this settlement was nonrecurring and unrelated to its normal operations; it was reported "below the line" as nonoperating income.
      >
      > Sun's Statement of Cash Flows, however, was less clear. The company recorded the $2 billion in cash as an operating inflow (as is appropriated under the indirect method), but it was not listed separately on the SCF; rather it was simply bondled with net income.

### Key Metrics Shenanigans

1. Showcasing misleading metrics that overstate performance
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Highlighting a misleading metric as a surrogate for revenue
      
      > Companies often prominently disclose SSS (_same-store sales_) in their Earnings Releases, and investors use it as a key indicator of company performance.
      >
      > ...
      >
      > However, because SSS fall outside of GAAP coverage, no universally accepted definition exists, and calculations may vary from company to company.

   2. Highlighting a misleading metric as a surrogate for earnings
      
      > ... management removed $97 million in expenses for interest, tax, depreciation and some other items to to a metric it called _adjusted EBITDA_ (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Then, it removed $15 million in non-cash stock compensation expense, bringing the company to and adjusted cash EBITDA of _negative_ $8 million.

   3. Highlighting a misleading metric as a surrogate for cash flow
      
      > Companies sometimes present metrics like "cash earnings" or "cash EBITDA" (as we just saw with Global Crossing). Do not confuse these metrics with substitutes for cash flow! Many companies and investors alike believe that these metrics (as well as plain old EBITDA) are good surrogates for cash flow simply because the calculation includes the adding back of noncash expenses such as depreciation.

2. Distorting Balance Sheet metrics to avoid showing deterioration
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Distorting accounts receivable metrics to hide revenue problems
      
      Mentioned under Cash Flow Shenanigans in ***Boosting CFFO by selling receivables before the collection date***

   2. Distorting inventory metrics to hide profitability problems
      
      Mentioned under Cash Flow Shenanigans in ***Boosting operating cash flow using unsustainable activities***

   3. Distorting financial asset metrics to hide impairment problems
      
      > New Century realized that investors would be seriously spooked if they knew that the company had reduced its reserves while its subprime loan portfolio was souring and that this reduction was the primary driver of earnings. Indeed, analysts who followed New Century were monitoring the company's allowance for loan losses closely as the subprime market started to crack. So when the company released its September 2006 results, management quietly changed its reserve presentation. ... the company grouped the loan loss reserve with another reserve (allowances for real estate owned) and presented the two together as one unit ... By combining the two reserves, New Century could say in its release that reserves increased from $236.5 million in June to $239 .4 million in September. However, the number on which investors had previously been focused&mdash;the loan loss reserve&mdash;declined from $209.9 million to $191.6 million. The loan loss reserve fell because bad loans that had been written off (call _charge-offs_) had accelerated and New Century had failed to record a sufficient expense to refill the reserve

   4. Distorting debt metrics to hide liquidity problems
      
      > The centerpiece of Parmalat's fraud seems to have been the company's use of offshore entities to hide fictitious or impaired assets, fabricate the reduction of debt, and create fake income. The scope of the fraudulent activities that Parmalat is alleged to have engaged in is quite amazing. SEC litigation against the company names a few, including forging the repurchase of its debt, faking the sale of bogus or uncollectible receivables, falsifying the payment of payables, recording fictional revenue, mischaracterizing debt as equity, disguising intercompany loans as income, and diverting company cash to various bisinesses owned by members of the CEO's family.

### Acquisition Accounting Shenanigans

1. Artificially boosting revenue and earnings
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Inflating profits through tricks at a target company before a deal closes
      
      > ... the goal of the target and acquirer: to make the postclosing period beautiful. One way to accomplish this goal is to depress earnings in the period just before the deal&mdash;called the _stub period_.

   2. Inflating profits by hiding losses at deal closing
      
      > Around 2008, Olympus had bought three companies and paid far more than they were worth, according to Woodford. This inflated price (totaling 30 percent of the deal value) was labeled "fees to a middleman." Woodford pointed out that the cut for investment bankers typically would be 1 to 2 percent, so the $674 million paid on the $2 billion deals likely was a payment to cover losses and move the investments off the Balance Sheet to an unconsolidated related-party entity.

   3. Creating dubious new revenue streams after closing
      
      > Both buyers and sellers of businesses have great flexibility in structuring a deal to create dubious future revenue streams. For example, assume Buyer Ben wants to purchase Seller Same's business, and they come to terms on a price of $5 million, which is the fair market value of the company. Buyer Ben then says to Seller Sam, "I will instead pay you $6 million (rather than the $5 million), provided you also agree to pay me a $1 million licensing fee next year." This change has no real economic impact to either Buyer Ben or Seller Sam, but the change in structure allows Ben to show $1 million more in revenue in the year following the acquisition.

   4. Inflating profits by releasing suspicious reserves either before or just after closing
      
      > The acquirer can also set up a bigger-than-necessary reserve for contingent consideration payments that might be paid to the owners of the target company, then later release some of the reserves back into income when they are deemed unnecessary.

2. Inflating reported cash flow
   
   Techniques involved includes,

   1. Inheriting operating inflows in a normal business acquisition
      
      > ... the mere act of acquiring a company provides benefit to CFFO. ... it's a peculiar side effect from the accounting rules that segregate cash flows into three sections
      >
      > Imagine you are a company that is getting ready to make a business acquisition. When you pay for the acquisition, you do so without affecting CFFO. If you buy the company with cash, the payment is recorded as an _investing outflow_. If you offer stock instead, there is, of course, no cash outflow.

   2. Acquiring contracts or customers rather than developing them internally
      
      > Among the hundreds of businesses Tyco owned was an electronic security monitoring provider. Home security monitoring was a fast-growing industry in the 1990s, and Tyco's ADT division proved to be among the most popular brand names. Tyco generated new security systems contracts in two ways: through its own direct sales force and through an external network of dealerships. The dealers allowed Tyco to outsource a portion of its sales force. They were not on Tyco's payroll, but they sold security contracts, and Tyco paid them about $800 for every new customer.
      >
      > ... Tyco executives did not view these $800 payments to dealers to be normal customer solicitation costs, as the economics would suggest. Instead, they deemed these payments to be a purchase price for the "acquisitions" of contracts.
      >
      > ... customer solicitation costs resemble normal operating expenditures much more closely than they resemble business acquisitions. As a result, it makes more sense for them to be recorded on the Statement of Cash Flows in the same way that Tyco's internal sales force commissions are recorded: as operating outflows.

   3. Boosting CFFO by creatively structuring the sale of a business
      
      This is basically doing an Earnings Manipulation after acquisition as mentioned under ***Creating reserves in conjunction with an acqusition and releasing them into income in a later period***

3. Manipulating key metrics
   
   > Sometimes a company will acquire a competitor in order to wind down a competing product and move the target's customers onto the acquirer's platform. This may be a good business strategy, but it could wreak havoc with organic growth metrics. For example, 3D printer manufacturer 3D Systems acquired competitor Z-Corp in 2012 and quickly announced that it would discontinue some of Z-Corp's products. Naturally, Z-Corp's revenue fell after being acquired, and 3D Systems reported strong organic growth. Any revenue growth that 3D Systems derived from legacy Z-Corp customers should not be considered organic.
