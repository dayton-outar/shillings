# Value Proposition

***Shillings*** caters to 3 major players of the stock market,
1. Investors
2. Brokers
3. Publicly Listed Companies

Brokers are the intermediaries needed to ensure investors abide by regulations, while the stock exchange focuses on settling trades. They are not the drivers in this industry. If _Shillings_ becomes a broker, the main focus will be on the investors and the publicly listed companies.

## Minimum Viable Segments

A _Minimum Viable Segment_ (MVS) refers to the smallest group of customers with distinct needs that a product or service must address to be considered viable. It involves identifying a specific and well-defined market segment that a business can serve effectively. The concept emphasizes the importance of focusing on a niche market to deliver a product that meets the unique requirements of a particular customer group. Identifying and satisfying the needs of this minimum viable segment is crucial for launching a successful product or service.

Four (4) MVS are drawn from the investor types in the stock market. The brokers are, currently, intermediaries and considered to be a MVS. The listed companies are a major MVS.

#### Tracy Trader, The Swing Income Trader

Tracy Trader is described as the Swing Income Trader because she seeks to generate a steady stream of income from dividend-paying stocks but she is also interested in the capital gains from stocks that increase in value. She swings from stock to stock for every opportunity to earn income. She is indeed a short-term investor that is entertained and committed to the stock market more than the long-term investor.
