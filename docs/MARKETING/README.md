# Marketing Strategy

This basically entails a breakdown of how we plan to reach the intended market for this product. For greater likelihood of reaching as much members of the market as possible, we need to profile the customer that we are serving, prepare the right communication for those customers and find them through the right channels.

There are a number of tactics to employ to win as much of the market as possible, even while starting with the _smallest viable market_. Most of these tactics has to be integral to the product that is offered to the customer. So, doing the research necessary to gather key insights into the customers behaviour and needs will help us to realize the goal of getting the most out of the market.

Branding will definitely set us up in the mental space of the market. So, the need to communicate the product through names, slogans and avatars will be critical.

We will need a good SEO strategy of acquiring backlinks through having several sites with high domain authority make reference to our site so that our site can rank high for customers that are looking for our product. Should we build a blog with relevant topics to gain that domain authority? This can be a time-consuming and expensive venture.

A really good SEO strategy can simply be put as "getting people to talk about your product". So, if we can get journalists, bloggers and central authority organizations to talk about (or make reference) to our online product that will certainly help in driving the traffic we need to our site. Social media influencers can play a very important part in driving traffic to our product. So, identifying the right communities and engaging the leaders with the right incentive can help this project.

From my observation of the existing products that are in a similar category to this product, many do not have a blog. See [competition analysis](./INDUSTRY/JM.md#competition-analysis). Some make use of sites that provide a hack around the search engine algorithm to increase the domain authority. This approach may get the domain authority score up to 20 but to get to a more formidable score like 70, a lot of public relations with sites that have domain authority between 20 and 70 is required.

Now, that's a lot of words spent on SEO strategy, which is just to get customers searching for a solution that this product can provide. When the customer (or better yet prospect) lands on the site, there is another discipline required to convert the prospect into a committed, paying customer. This is _Content Marketing_. To usher a prospect into using the product, we will have to make use of a good combination of literature delivered at the right time for the prospect. Literature in the form of guides, infographics, instagram posts, blog posts and videos (to name a few).

To know the most appropriate literature for the prospect at the _right time_ we need to take note of the buyer and his journey in finding solutions to his/her problem.

![Buyer's Journey](/.attachments/content-format-buyers-journey.png)

A buyer's journey would not be complete without _Buyer Personas_, which is basically the profile of the targeted prospects (or customers). The buyer persona usually includes some demographics but most importantly buying insights that influences their decision-making.
