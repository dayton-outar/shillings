# Market Research

Conducting effective business research involves a systematic and structured approach to gather relevant information and insights to make informed decisions. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to conduct business research:

1. **Define Your Research Objectives:**
   Clearly outline what you want to achieve through your research. Determine the specific goals, questions, or problems you need to address. This will help you focus your research efforts and ensure that you're gathering relevant information.

2. **Choose Your Research Methodology:**
   Depending on your objectives and available resources, decide on the appropriate research methodology. Common methods include:
   - **Quantitative Research:** Involves collecting and analyzing numerical data through surveys, experiments, and statistical analysis.
   - **Qualitative Research:** Involves gathering non-numerical data through methods like interviews, focus groups, and content analysis.
   - **Desk Research:** Involves gathering information from existing sources such as reports, articles, books, and online databases.

3. **Create a Research Plan:**
   Develop a detailed plan that outlines the steps you'll take to conduct your research. Include the research methods you'll use, the timeline, budget, and the roles and responsibilities of team members involved.

4. **Gather Data:**
   Depending on your chosen methodology, start collecting relevant data. This could involve conducting surveys, interviews, analyzing financial statements, market trends, competitor data, and other sources of information that align with your research objectives.

5. **Evaluate Data Quality:**
   Ensure the accuracy, relevance, and reliability of the data you gather. Consider the sources, methodology, and potential biases that could influence the data. Cross-reference information from multiple sources when possible.

6. **Analyze Data:**
   Process and analyze the collected data to extract meaningful insights. This could involve statistical analysis, thematic coding for qualitative data, and identifying trends and patterns.

7. **Interpret Results:**
   Interpret the findings of your analysis in the context of your research objectives. What do the results mean for your business decisions? Are there actionable insights that can be derived from the data?

8. **Draw Conclusions:**
   Summarize the key takeaways from your research. Address the initial research objectives and provide recommendations or conclusions based on the insights gained.

9. **Create a Report or Presentation:**
   Compile your findings, insights, and recommendations into a clear and well-structured report or presentation. Use visuals like charts and graphs to support your points. Make sure your report is tailored to your target audience, whether it's internal stakeholders, clients, or investors.

10. **Implement Insights:**
    Apply the insights you've gained from your research to make informed business decisions. This could involve strategic planning, product development, marketing strategies, or any other relevant areas.

11. **Monitor and Adjust:**
    Continuously monitor the outcomes of the decisions you've made based on your research. If necessary, make adjustments based on new information or changing circumstances.

Remember that conducting thorough business research requires attention to detail, critical thinking, and the ability to synthesize information into actionable insights. It's also important to stay updated with the latest research methods and tools in order to conduct more effective and efficient research.

Developing an effective marketing strategy is crucial for any business that wants to have success. Every accomplished businessperson has heard about these important elements of a marketing plan. Sadly, many small business owners don’t take marketing seriously despite knowing how important it is for the growth of their company.

We have seen many smaller companies do their marketing in a chaotic manner – doing a little bit of branding, advertising, and sales here and there, but not having much of an idea about the impact of their activities.

Not having your marketing plan elements set up properly could lead to a waste of resources and money in the future. In marketing (and in business generally) it’s a good idea to have set goals, activities and ways of measuring your efforts.

When you are just starting to write a marketing plan, it is important to first focus on the main elements you want to address. Some of the marketing elements can be situational, but most of them are usually derived from standard marketing principles. Those principles stay true to any business, from a hair salon to an international logistics business.

### 1. Market Research

Conducting [market research](./RESEARCH/) can be one of the most tedious tasks at first, but it will pay dividends for years after. This part should take up the biggest chunk of your planning – sure, too much research and not enough action can be harmful, but in most cases, we see people not going in-depth enough and ending up paying expensive marketing companies to do their homework for them.


1. Market Size

   This is incredibly important for local businesses. What is the approximate market size for your product/service? For example, if you are selling cars: how many households there are in your area, that have a base income of over ____? How often do people buy new cars in your area?

2. [Industry](./INDUSTRY/) and Industry Standards
   
   Current landscape of the major players (or stakeholders) within the industry. Current sales statistics in your industry, for example, average pricing, average turnovers and so on.

3. Market Dynamics
   
   Are your products/services seasonal? When do people tend to purchase more and when less? This is incredibly important when planning your advertising activities.

4. Competition Analysis
   
   Who are they? How do they do their marketing activities? How could their activities impact your company? How does their product/service differ from others?

5. Product/Service Analysis
   
   How does your product/service compare to others in the market? What are your main selling points? How does your product/service stand out? Are there any smaller things you could tweak to make a fast improvement?

### 2. Target Market

Knowing your target market is a crucial element for any sort of marketing activity – otherwise, you could end up taking shots in the dark.

A good way to identify your target market is to look at the customer base you already have.

When identifying your target market look at the following data:

- **Age:** What is the average age range for your customers?
- **Gender:** Are your customers male/female or both?
- **Language:** What language do your customers speak?
- **Interests:** Are there any commonalities between your customers in terms of their interests?
- **Stage of life:** In what stage of life are your customers? For example, they could be college students or parents.

We recommend reading [What Is a Target Market (And How to Find Yours in 2023)](https://blog.hootsuite.com/target-market/) for more information on target market identification. Here are a few snippets,

 > Your target market sets the tone for your entire marketing strategy — from how you develop and name your products or services right through to the marketing channels you use to promote them.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > Don’t be afraid to get highly specific. This is all about targeting your marketing efforts effectively, not stopping people from buying your product.
 >
 > ...
 >
 > Some data points you might want to consider are:
 >
 > - **Age:** You don’t need to get too specific here. It won’t likely make a difference whether your average customer is 24 or 27. But knowing which decade of life your customers are in can be very useful.
 > - **Location (and time zone):** Where in the world do your existing customers live? In addition to understanding which geographic areas to target, this helps you figure out what hours are most important for your customer service and sales reps to be online, and [what time](https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-social-media/) you should schedule your social ads and posts to ensure best visibility.
 > - **Language:** Don’t assume your customers speak the same language you do. And don’t assume they speak the dominant language of their (or your) current physical location.
 > - **Spending power and patterns:** How much money do your current customers have to spend? How do they approach purchases in your price category?
 > - **Interests:** What do your customers like to do, besides using your products or services? What TV shows do they watch? What other businesses do they interact with?
 > - **Challenges:** What pain points are your customers facing? Do you understand how your product or service helps them address those challenges?
 > - **Stage of life:** Are your customers likely to be college students? New parents? Parents of teens? Retirees?
 >
 > ...
 >
 > Now it’s time to boil everything you’ve discovered so far into one simple statement that defines your target market. This is actually the first step in creating a **brand positioning statement**, but that’s a project for another day. For now, let’s stick to creating a statement that clearly defines your target market.
 >
 > For example, here’s Zipcar’s brand positioning statement, as cited in the classic marketing text Kellogg on Marketing. We’re interested in the first part of the statement, which defines the target market:
 >
 > “To **urban-dwelling, educated, techno-savvy consumers who worry about the environment** that future generations will inherit, Zipcar is the car-sharing service that lets you save money and reduce your carbon footprint, making you feel you’ve made a smart, responsible choice that demonstrates your commitment to protecting the environment.”

### 3. Goals

Setting the right goals will help you to define the most appropriate marketing strategies and budgets. When setting your marketing goals, you should first consider analyzing the goals of your business/organization.

#### Business Goals

Goals give businesses directions and ambitions – without them, it would be difficult to grow and expand.

Business goals could be, for example, increasing sales revenue, expanding the customer base, increasing customer satisfaction, increasing customer lifetime value and so on.

Knowing your business goals will help you to set appropriate marketing goals that will directly support your business.

#### Marketing Goals

Good marketing goals have one thing in common – they are measurable. Because of the nature of marketing, it is quite often difficult to objectively measure the impact of your efforts. Digital marketing has made goal tracking much more measurable then it was in the past, but often our marketing activities will still have effects we cannot see.

Your marketing goals could be increasing brand awareness, increasing the number of leads that your sales team gets, increasing in-store traffic and so on.

### 4. Marketing Strategy

After doing your market research, identifying your target audience and setting your marketing goals the next important element is to develop a marketing strategy. Select what marketing or promotional strategies you want to work on.

Some of the most common ones are:

- Advertising in print media (newspapers, journals, magazines, directories)
- Advertising on social media (Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, Tiktok)
- Advertising on Google (Google Ads, display network, youtube, SEO)
- Submitting press releases and gaining publicity
- Direct marketing letters, flyers
- Attending different trade shows
- Direct selling by calling prospects or e-mailing them
- Writing articles to different media outlets

And the list can go on.

Here are some other ideas and strategies that might help to get your imagination working:

- Depending on the business it is also possible to incorporate different offer strategies like seasonal offers, discounts or added benefits which will also assist your business goals.

- Easiest sales usually come from referrals. If you can find a way to get more referrals through your marketing work, you could bring in some fast results.

- Unconventional methods could also bring a lot of attention. These could be doing product demonstrations in unusual places, doing a flash mob in the streets, we’ve even seen companies put stickers in public places to get more attention.

### 5. Budget

One of the most important elements in your marketing plan is going to be your budget. The size of your marketing activities is going to be determined by the budget you can spend on different campaigns.

What things can you do by yourself – what services do you need to outsource? Which strategies are looking more promising?

When setting your budget, also think about what has worked for you in the past – if possible expand on that.

### Conclusion

...

> Here are some questions to ask in evaluating a marketing plan.
> 
> 1. Is the plan simple and succinct? Is it easy to understand and act on? Does it communicate its content clearly and practically? Is it not unnecessarily
long?
> 
> 2. Is the plan complete? Does it include all the necessary elements? Does it have the right breadth and depth? Achieving the right balance between
­completeness and lots of detail and simplicity and clear focus is often the key to a well-constructed marketing plan.
> 
> 3. Is the plan specific? Are its objectives concrete and measurable? Does it provide a clear course of action? Does it include specific activities, each with
 specific dates of completion, specific persons responsible, and specific budgets?
>
> 4. Is the plan realistic? Are the sales goals, expense budgets, and milestone dates realistic? Has a frank and honest self-critique been conducted to raise
possible concerns and objections? [^1]
