# Financial Ratios

There's so much that can be gathered from Financial Statements to indicate the performance and overall health of a company. Given that there are no shenanigans, the ratios (or multipliers as Benjamin Graham would call them) are good indicators of _liquidity & solvency_, _efficiency_, _profitability_ and the _market prospects_ of its common stock on a stock exchange. Based on this observation, the approach to aggregating and reporting on financial reports has been classified within these categories.

## Liquidity & Solvency

According to Investopedia,

> **Liquidity** refers to both an enterprise's ability to pay short-term bills and debts and a company's capability to sell assets quickly to raise cash. **Solvency** refers to a company's ability to meet long-term debts and continue operating into the future.

To get an idea of the _liquidity_ of a company the following ratios can be used,

 - Quick Ratio

   This is also called the _acid test ratio_ and it can be calculated as,

   $$\large
   \text{Quick Ratio} = { {\text{Total of Current Assets} - \text{Total of Inventories}} \over \text{Total of Current Liabilities} }
   $$

   A value below 1 means that the company will have to sell long-term asset (a fixed asset) in order to pay off its current liabilities if they have a cashflow problem. A value greater than 1 means that the company can pay off its current liabilities without selling any long-term assets.

   A company in good health should have a _quick ratio_ greater than or equal to 1. According to Financial Times, Supermarkets usually show a _Quick Ratio_ of around 0.2, which is acceptable because of the rapidly moving stock items matched by high levels of trade creditors (a current liability).[^1]

 - Current Ratio
   
   The current ratio, which is also an indicator or _working capital_, is calculated as,

   $$\large
   \text{Current Ratio} = { \text{Total of Current Assets} \over \text{Total of Current Liabilities} }
   $$

   The implications of this ratio are similar to the _Quick Ratio_. The difference is that inventories are considered part of the _liquidity_. Anything item on a Balance Sheet classified _current_ indicates that it must be paid for within the year. So, whereas _Quick Ratio_ is more immediate, _Current Ratio_ considers cashflows that is given a year to occur.

   When current assets exceed current liabilities, the company has enough capital to run its daily operations. For this reason, the _Current Ratio_ is also referred to as _Working Capital Ratio_.

   A value below 1 means that the company is not running efficiently because it cannot cover it's current liabilities properly. It will experience cashflow issues and take long to pay off its short-term debts (i.e. current liabilities like payables).

   A company in good health should have a _current ratio_ greater than or equal to 1 but should not be greater than 2. A _Current Ratio_ greater than 2 means that the company is risking devaluation of excess cash due to inflation.

 - Debt-to-Equity Ratio

   The more useful _Debt-to-Equity_ ratio narrows the debt value to long-term debts owed to a financial institution such as a bank rather than all liabilities. This is considered to be a _Modified D/E Ratio_ also recognized as _Capital Gearing_, which would be calculated as,

   $$\large
   \text{Debt-to-Equity} = {\text{Long-term Debt} \over \text{Shareholder's Equity}}
   $$

   A value at or below 0.5 should make lenders and shareholders comfortable[^2] but a value greater than 1 would be a matter of concern, especially for equity holders. This can be considered a ratio of ownership between creditors and equity holders. When the value is greater than 1, the creditors have a greater ownership stake and it could mean that the company is about to file for bankruptcy.

## Efficiency

The _efficiency_ ratios seeks to take a peek into the operating activities of the company by using key items from the statements of the financial reports. Some of the key items includes: Revenues, Receivables, Inventory and Cost of Sales.

Let's take a look at these ratios.

 - Accounts Receivable Turnover

   This ratio is a measure of efficiently the company converts its _Accounts Receivables_ into cash. This is calculated as,

   $$\large
   \text{Accounts Receivable Turnover} = { \text{Revenues} \over \frac{1}{2} (\text{ Current Period Accounts Receivable} + \text{Previous Period Accounts Receivables} ) }
   $$

   A value ...

 - Inventory Turnover
