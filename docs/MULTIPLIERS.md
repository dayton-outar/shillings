# Financial Ratios

There's so much that can be gathered from Financial Statements to indicate the performance and overall health of a company. Given that there are no shenanigans, the ratios (or multipliers as Benjamin Graham would call them) are good indicators of _liquidity & solvency_, _efficiency_, _profitability_ and the _market prospects_ of its common stock on a stock exchange. Based on this observation, the approach to aggregating and reporting on financial reports has been classified within these categories.

## Liquidity & Solvency

According to Investopedia,

> **Liquidity** refers to both an enterprise's ability to pay short-term bills and debts and a company's capability to sell assets quickly to raise cash. **Solvency** refers to a company's ability to meet long-term debts and continue operating into the future.

To get an idea of the _liquidity_ of a company the following ratios can be used,

 - Quick Ratio

   This is also called the _acid test ratio_ and it can be calculated as,

   $$\large \text{Quick Ratio} = { {\text{Total of Current Assets} - \text{Total of Inventories}} \over \text{Total of Current Liabilities} }$$

   A value below 1 means that the company will have to sell long-term asset (a fixed asset) in order to pay off its current liabilities if they have a cashflow problem. A value greater than 1 means that the company can pay off its current liabilities without selling any long-term assets.

   A company in good health should have a _quick ratio_ greater than or equal to 1. According to Financial Times, Supermarkets usually show a _Quick Ratio_ of around 0.2, which is acceptable because of the rapidly moving stock items matched by high levels of trade creditors (a current liability).[^1]

 - Current Ratio
   
   The current ratio, which is also an indicator or _working capital_, is calculated as,

   $$\large \text{Current Ratio} = { \text{Total of Current Assets} \over \text{Total of Current Liabilities} }$$

   The implications of this ratio are similar to the _Quick Ratio_. The difference is that inventories are considered part of the _liquidity_. Anything item on a Balance Sheet classified _current_ indicates that it must be paid for within the year. So, whereas _Quick Ratio_ is more immediate, _Current Ratio_ considers cashflows that is given a year to occur.

   When current assets exceed current liabilities, the company has enough capital to run its daily operations. For this reason, the _Current Ratio_ is also referred to as _Working Capital Ratio_.

   A value below 1 means that the company is not running efficiently because it cannot cover it's current liabilities properly. It will experience cashflow issues and take long to pay off its short-term debts (i.e. current liabilities like payables).

   A company in good health should have a _current ratio_ greater than or equal to 1 but should not be greater than 2. A _Current Ratio_ greater than 2 means that the company is risking devaluation of excess cash due to inflation.

 - Debt-to-Equity Ratio

   The more useful _Debt-to-Equity_ ratio narrows the debt value to long-term debts owed to a financial institution such as a bank rather than all liabilities. This is considered to be a _Modified D/E Ratio_ also recognized as _Capital Gearing_, which would be calculated as,

   $$\large \text{Debt-to-Equity} = {\text{Long-term Debt} \over \text{Shareholder's Equity}}$$

   A value at or below 0.5 should make lenders and shareholders comfortable[^2] but a value greater than 1 would be a matter of concern, especially for equity holders. This can be considered a ratio of ownership between creditors and equity holders. When the value is greater than 1, the creditors have a greater ownership stake and it could mean that the company is about to file for bankruptcy.

## Efficiency

The _efficiency_ ratios seeks to take a peek into the operating activities of the company by using key items from the statements of the financial reports. Some of the key items includes: Revenues, Receivables, Inventory and Cost of Sales.

Let's take a look at these ratios.

 - Receivables Turnover

   This ratio is a measure of efficiently the company converts its _Accounts Receivables_ into cash. This is calculated as,

   $$\large \text{Receivables Turnover} = { \text{Revenues} \over \text{Average Accounts Receivables} }$$

   The _Average Accounts Receivables_ for 2 periods could be calculated as,

   $$\large \text{Average Accounts Receivables} = \frac{1}{2} (\text{ Current Period Accounts Receivable} + \text{Previous Period Accounts Receivables} )$$

   This ratio becomes more easily understood when it is used to divide 365 days to give the _Average Collection Period_. The _Average Collection Period_ states the number of days that the company takes to collect monies owed it from offering goods and services to its customers. The shorter the period is, the better it will be for the companies cashflow. However, there is no set scale on which the number of days would raise concern but it can be used to compare to other companies as a measure of efficiency. According to Investopedia, it is more preferrable to have an _Average Collection Period_ of 25 days.[^3]

 - Inventory Turnover

   $$\large \text{Inventory Turnover} = { \text{} \over \text{Average Cost of Inventory} }$$

   The _Average Cost of Inventory_ for 2 periods could be calculated as,

   $$\large \text{Average Cost of Inventory} = \frac{1}{2} (\text{ Current Cost of Inventory} + \text{Previous Cost of Inventory})$$

   When we use this ratio to divide 365 days to give the _Days Sales of Inventory_. The number of days determined from _Days Sales of Inventory_ is a measure of how quickly the company can convert its stock of inventory into sales.[^4] A low number of days determined by the _Day Sales of Inventory_ indicates high efficiency. There is no set scale but it can be used to compare against other companies or to compare the performance of the same company against other periods.

## Profitability

_Profitability_ ratios are the most attractive and sought after ratios (or multipliers). Given there are no shenanigans, it's usually a good baseline for them to seriously consider investing in a particular stock.

Here are the ratios use to determine the _Profitability_ of a company.

 - Profit margin
 - Return on Equity
 - Return on Assets
 - Return on Capital Employed

## Market Prospects

 - Earnings Per Share
 - Price-to-Earnings Ratio
 - Dividend Payout Ratio
 - Dividend Yield
