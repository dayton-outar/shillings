# Talent Management

Managing talent involves communicating values in order to foster a culture.

## Management Values and Culture

[TODO: Revise and refine]

### Supervisory Development:
- **Management by Walking Around**: Be visible and engaged.
- **Management by Walking the Talk**: Lead by example.
- Supervisors should be **firm, fair, and friendly**.
- The **Johari Window**: Find a balance in what to share with staff—too little leads to assumptions, too much can reduce respect.
- Use a **friendly and respectful approach** for sensitive matters and give **continuous feedback** to build trust.
- **Body language** and **proximity** matter—stand side by side, avoid defensiveness.

### Communication:
The **7 C’s of Communication** are:
1. **Candid**: Be honest.
2. **Clarity**: Ensure messages are clear.
3. **Completeness**: Cover all relevant information (5 W's: What, Who, Where, When, Why).
4. **Conciseness**: Be brief and to the point.
5. **Concreteness**: Provide specific information.
6. **Courtesy**: Communicate respectfully.
7. **Correctness**: Ensure proper grammar and accuracy.

### Customer Service:
- Avoid **complacency** and actively seek customer feedback.
- **CRM (Customer Relationship Management)** and **CEM (Customer Experience Management)** balance transactional and emotional interactions with customers.
- The **customer isn’t always right**, but resolving their problem is key.
- Build **brand loyalty** by focusing on the 3 P’s: **Product**, **Procedures**, and **People**.
  
These principles aim to foster trust, effective communication, and customer satisfaction.
