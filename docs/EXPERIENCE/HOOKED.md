# Hooked

© 2014 by Nir Eyal

## Introduction

> Forming habits is imperative for the survival of many products. As infinite distractions compete for our attention, companies are learning to master novel tactics to stay relevant in users’ minds. Amassing millions of users is no longer good enough. Companies increasingly find that their economic value is a function of the strength of the habits they create. In order to win the loyalty of their users and create a product that’s regularly used, companies must learn not only what compels users to click but also what makes them tick.
> 
> Although some companies are just waking up to this new reality, others are already cashing in. By mastering habit-forming product design, the companies profiled in this book make their goods indispensable.
> 
> ...
> 
> Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to the users’ daily routines and emotions.7 A habit is at work when users feel a tad bored and instantly open Twitter. They feel a pang of loneliness and before rational thought occurs, they are scrolling through their Facebook feeds. A question comes to mind and before searching their brains, they query Google. The first-to-mind solution wins. In chapter 1 of this book, we explore the competitive advantages of habit-forming products.

> **The Hook Model**

![The Hook Model Illustration](/.attachments/hook-model.jpeg)

> A _trigger_ is the actuator of behavior—the spark plug in the engine. Triggers come in two types: external and internal.8 Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external triggers like an e-mail, a Web site link, or the app icon on a phone.
> 
> ...
> 
> Following the trigger comes the action: the behavior done in anticipation of a reward.
>
> ...
> 
> What distinguishes the Hook Model from a plain vanilla feedback loop is the Hook’s ability to create a craving. Feedback loops are all around us, but predictable ones don’t create desire. The unsurprising response of your fridge light turning on when you open the door doesn’t drive you to keep opening it again and again. However, add some variability to the mix—suppose a different treat magically appears in your fridge every time you open it—and voilà, intrigue is created.
> 
> ...
> 
> The last phase of the Hook Model is where the user does a bit of work. The investment phase increases the odds that the user will make another pass through the Hook cycle in the future. The investment occurs when the user puts something into the product of service such as time, data, effort, social capital, or money.
>
> However, the investment phase isn’t about users opening up their wallets and moving on with their day. Rather, the investment implies an action that improves the service for the next go-around. Inviting friends, stating preferences, building virtual assets, and learning to use new features are all investments users make to improve their experience. These commitments can be leveraged to make the trigger more engaging, the action easier, and the reward more exciting with every pass through the Hook cycle.

## Chapter 1. The Habit Zone

> Habits are one of the ways the brain learns complex behaviors. Neuroscientists believe habits give us the ability to focus our attention on other things by storing automatic responses in the basal ganglia, an area of the brain associated with involuntary actions.2
> 
> Habits form when the brain takes a shortcut and stops actively deliberating over what to do next.3 The brain quickly learns to codify behaviors that provide a solution to whatever situation it encounters.
>
> ...
> 
> ... Entrepreneurs should evaluate how user habits impact their particular business model and goals. While the viability of some products depends on habit-formation to thrive, that is not always the case.
>
> For example, companies selling infrequently bought or used products or services do not require habitual users—at least, not in the sense of everyday engagement. Life insurance companies, for instance, leverage salespeople, advertising, and word-of-mouth referrals and recommendations to prompt consumers to buy policies. Once the policy is bought, there is nothing more the customer needs to do.
> 
> ...
> 
> MBAs are taught that a business is worth the sum of its future profits. This benchmark is how investors calculate the fair price of a company’s shares.
> 
> ...
> 
> Fostering consumer habits is an effective way to increase the value of a company by driving higher customer lifetime value (CLTV): the amount of money made from a customer before that person switches to a competitor, stops using the product, or dies. User habits increase how long and how frequently customers use a product, resulting in higher CLTV.
> 
> Some products have a very high CLTV. For example, credit card customers tend to stay loyal for a very long time and are worth a bundle. Hence, credit card companies are willing to spend a considerable amount of money acquiring new customers. This explains why you receive so many promotional offers, ranging from free gifts to airline bonus miles, to entice you to add another card or upgrade your current one. Your potential CLTV justifies a credit card company’s marketing investment.
>
> ...
>
> ... Buffett and Munger understand that habits give companies greater flexibility to increase prices.
>
> For example, in the free-to-play video game business, it is standard practice for game developers to delay asking users to pay money until they have played consistently and habitually. Once the compulsion to play is in place and the desire to progress in the game increases, converting users into paying customers is much easier. The real money lies in selling virtual items, extra lives, and special powers.
>
> ...
> 
> Evernote’s CEO Phil Libin shared some revealing insights about how the company turns nonpaying users into revenue-generating ones.7 In 2011 Libin published a chart now known as the “smile graph.” With the percentage of sign-ups represented on the y-axis and time spent on the service on the x-axis, the chart showed that, although usage plummeted at first, it rocketed upward as people formed a habit of using the service. The resulting down-and-up curve gave the chart its emblematic smile shape (and Evernote’s CEO a matching grin).
> 
> In addition, as usage increased over time, so did customers’ willingness to pay. Libin noted that after the first month, only 0.5 percent of users paid for the service; however, this rate gradually increased. By month thirty-three, 11 percent of users had started paying. At month forty-two, a remarkable 26 percent of customers were paying for something they had previously used for free.
>
> Users who continuously find value in a product are more likely to tell their friends about it. Frequent usage creates more opportunities to encourage people to invite their friends, broadcast content, and share through word of mouth. Hooked users become brand evangelists—megaphones for your company, bringing in new users at little or no cost.

This underscores Seth Godin's point about going for publicity first and starting with the _smallest viable market_. Once those in that market is pleased, they will do the advertising for the product.

> Products with higher user engagement also have the potential to grow faster than their rivals. Case in point: Facebook leapfrogged its competitors, including MySpace and Friendster, even though it was relatively late to the social networking party. Although its competitors both had healthy growth rates and millions of users by the time Mark Zuckerberg’s fledgling site launched beyond the closed doors of academia, his company came to dominate the industry.
>
> Facebook’s success was, in part, a result of what I call the more is more principle—more frequent usage drives more viral growth.
> 
> ...
> 
> Many entrepreneurs fall into the trap of building products that are only marginally better than existing solutions, hoping their innovation will be good enough to woo customers away from existing products. But when it comes to shaking consumers’ old habits, these naive entrepreneurs often find that better products don’t always win—especially if a large number of users have already adopted a competing product.
> 
> ...
> 
> Gourville claims that for new entrants to stand a chance, they can’t just be better, they must be nine times better. Why such a high bar? Because old habits die hard and new products or services need to offer dramatic improvements to shake users out of old routines. Gourville writes that products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail even if the benefits of using the new product are clear and substantial.

> 
> For new behaviors to really take hold, they must occur often.

> 
> So why haven’t more Google users switched to Bing? Habits keep users loyal. If a user is familiar with the Google interface, switching to Bing requires cognitive effort. Although many aspects of Bing are similar to Google, even a slight change in pixel placement forces the would-be user to learn a new way of interacting with the site. Adapting to the differences in the Bing interface is what actually slows down regular Google users and makes Bing feel inferior, not the technology itself.

Is this the Law of First working against competitors of Google. Google is perceived as the leader and was first to occupy the mind of the consumer and, since, the consumer has developed habits around Google it has now become hard to change.

> A 2010 study found that some habits can be formed in a matter of weeks while others can take more than five months.23 The researchers also found that the complexity of the behavior and how important the habit was to the person greatly affected how quickly the routine was formed.

## Chapter 2. Trigger

> Yin doesn’t realize she’s hooked, although she admits she regularly snaps and posts dozens of pictures per day using the app [Instagram]. “It’s just fun,” she says as she reviews her latest collection of moody snapshots filtered to look like they were taken in the late 1970s. _“I don’t have a problem or anything. I just use it whenever I see something cool. I feel I need to grab it before it’s gone.”_
>
> ...
> 
> Habit-forming technologies start changing behavior by first cueing users with a call to action. This sensory stimuli is delivered through any number of things in our environment.
> 
> ...
> 
> An **external trigger** communicates the next action the user should take. Often, the desired action is made explicitly clear.
>
> ...
> 
> Companies can utilize four types of **external triggers** to move users to complete desired actions:
> 
> 1. Paid Triggers
> 
>    Advertising, search engine marketing, and other paid channels are commonly used to get users’ attention and prompt them to act. Paid triggers can be effective but costly ways to keep users coming back. Habit-forming companies tend not to rely on paid triggers for very long, if at all. Imagine if Facebook or Twitter needed to buy an ad to prompt users to revisit their sites—these companies would soon go broke.
>
> 2. Earned Triggers
> 
>    Earned triggers are free in that they cannot be bought directly, but they often require investment in the form of time spent on public and media relations. Favorable press mentions, hot viral videos, and featured app store placements are all effective ways to gain attention. Companies may be lulled into thinking that related downloads or sales spikes signal long-term success, yet awareness generated by earned triggers can be short-lived.
> 
> 3. Relationship Triggers
> 
>    One person telling others about a product or service can be a highly effective external trigger for action. Whether through an electronic invitation, a Facebook “like,” or old fashioned word of mouth, product referrals from friends and family are often a key component of technology diffusion.
>    
>    ...
>    
>    Unfortunately, some companies utilize viral loops and relationship triggers in unethical ways: by deploying so-called dark patterns. When designers intentionally trick users into inviting friends or blasting a message to their social networks, they may see some initial growth, but it comes at the expense of users’ goodwill and trust. When people discover they’ve been duped, they vent their frustration and stop using the product.
>    
>    Proper use of relationship triggers requires building an engaged user base that is enthusiastic about sharing the benefits of the product with others.
>    
> 4. Owned Triggers
>    
>    Owned triggers consume a piece of real estate in the user’s environment. They consistently show up in daily life and it is ultimately up to the user to opt in to allowing these triggers to appear.
>    
>    For example, an app icon on the user’s phone screen, an e-mail newsletter to which the user subscribes, or an app update notification only appears if the user wants it there. As long as the user agrees to receive a trigger, the company that sets the trigger owns a share of the user’s attention.
> 
> When a product becomes tightly coupled with a thought, an emotion, or a preexisting routine, it leverages an **internal trigger**. Unlike external triggers, which use sensory stimuli like a morning alarm clock or giant “Login Now” button, you can’t see, touch, or hear an **internal trigger**.
> 
> ...
> 
> Emotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers and greatly influence our daily routines. Feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion, and indecisiveness often instigate a slight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the negative sensation. For instance, Yin often uses Instagram when she fears a special moment will be lost forever.

This emotion that Yin experiences is called FOMO - Fear of Missing Out.

> The severity of the discomfort may be relatively minor—perhaps her fear is below the perceptibility of consciousness—but that’s exactly the point. Our life is filled with tiny stressors and we’re usually unaware of our habitual reactions to these nagging issues.
>
> Positive emotions can also serve as internal triggers, and may even be triggered themselves by a need to satisfy something that is bothering us. After all, we use products to find solutions to problems. The desire to be entertained can be thought of as the need to satiate boredom. A need to share good news can also be thought of as an attempt to find and maintain social connections.
> 
> ...
> 
> The study demonstrated that people suffering from symptoms of depression used the Internet more. Why is that? One hypothesis is that those with depression experience negative emotions more frequently than the general population and seek relief by turning to technology to lift their mood.
> 
> ...
> 
> When bored, many people seek excitement and turn to dramatic news headlines. When we feel overly stressed, we seek serenity, perhaps finding relief in sites like Pinterest. When we feel lonely, destinations like Facebook and Twitter provide instant social connections.
> 
> Once we’re hooked, using these products does not always require an explicit call to action. Instead, they rely upon our automatic responses to feelings that precipitate the desired behavior. Products that attach to these internal triggers provide users with quick relief. ***Once a technology has created an association in users’ minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers***.
>
> The association between an internal trigger and your product, however, is not formed overnight. It can take weeks or months of frequent usage for internal triggers to latch onto cues. New habits are sparked by external triggers, but associations with internal triggers are what keeps users hooked.
>
> ...
> 
> ... _Finding customers’ internal triggers requires learning more about people than what they can tell you in a survey, though. It requires digging deeper to understand how your users feel._
> 
> _The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user’s pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company’s product or service as the source of relief._
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Yet talking to users to reveal these wants will likely prove ineffective because they themselves don’t know which emotions motivate them. People just don’t think in these terms. You’ll often find that people’s _declared preferences_ — what they say they want — are far different from their _revealed preferences_ — what they actually do.
> 
> ...
> 
> What would your users want to achieve by using your solution? Where and when will they use it? What emotions influence their use and will trigger them to action?
> 
> ...
> 
> Dorsey believes a clear description of users—their desires, emotions, the context with which they use the product—is paramount to building the right solution. In addition to Dorsey’s user narratives, tools like customer development,11 usability studies, and empathy maps12 are examples of methods for learning about potential users.
> 
> One method is to try asking the question “Why?” as many times as it takes to get to an emotion. Usually, this will happen by the fifth why.
>
> ...
> 
> A large component of Instagram’s success—and what brings its millions of users back nearly every day—is the company’s ability to understand its users’ triggers. For people like Yin, Instagram is a harbor for emotions and inspirations, a virtual memoir preserved in pixels.
> 
> Yin’s habitual use of the service started with an external trigger—a recommendation from a friend and weeks of repetitious use before she became a regular user.

## Chapter 3. Action

> The trigger, driven by internal or external cues, informs the user of what to do next; however, if the user does not take action, the trigger is useless. To initiate action, doing must be easier than thinking. Remember, a habit is a behavior done with little or no conscious thought. The more effort—either physical or mental—required to perform the desired action, the less likely it is to occur.
>
> ...
> 
> _Fogg posits that there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior._
>
> The Fogg Behavior Model is represented in the formula B = MAT, which represents that a given behavior will occur when motivation, ability, and a trigger are present at the same time and in sufficient degrees. If any component of this formula is missing or inadequate, the user will not cross the “Action Line” and the behavior will not occur.
>
> ...
> 
> While a trigger cues an action, **motivation** defines the level of desire to take that action.
> 
> ...
> 
> Fogg states that all humans are motivated ***to seek pleasure and avoid pain***; ***to seek hope and avoid fear***; and finally, ***to seek social acceptance and avoid rejection***. The two sides of the three Core Motivators can be thought of as levers to increase or decrease the likelihood of someone’s taking a particular action by increasing or decreasing that person’s motivation.
> 
> ...
> 
> However, even with the right trigger enabled and motivation running high, product designers often find users still don’t behave the way they want them to. What’s missing in this equation? Usability—or rather, the **ability** of the user to take action easily.
> 
> ...
> 
> Seven years after Blogger’s birth, a new company described at first as a “microblogging” service sought to bring sharing to the masses: Twitter. For many, blogging was still a difficult, time-consuming venture, but anyone could type short, casual messages. Tweeting began to enter the national lexicon as Twitter gained wider adoption, climbing to 500 million registered users by 2012.5 Critics first discounted Twitter’s 140-character message limitation as gimmicky and restrictive; little did they realize the constraint actually increased users’ ability to create. A few keyboard taps and users were sharing. As of late 2013, 340 million tweets were sent every day.
> 
> ...
> 
> Fogg describes six “elements of simplicity”—the factors that influence a task’s difficulty.6 These are:
> 
> 1. Time—how long it takes to complete an action.
> 2. Money—the fiscal cost of taking an action.
> 3. Physical effort—the amount of labor involved in taking the action.
> 4. Brain cycles—the level of mental effort and focus required to take an action.
> 5. Social deviance—how accepted the behavior is by others.
> 6. Non-routine—according to Fogg, “How much the action matches or disrupts existing routines.”
>
> To increase the likelihood that a behavior will occur, Fogg instructs designers to focus on simplicity as a function of the user’s scarcest resource at that moment. In other words: Identify what the user is missing. What is making it difficult for the user to accomplish the desired action?
> 
> Is the user short on time? Is the behavior too expensive? Is the user exhausted after a long day of work? Is the product too difficult to understand? Is the user in a social context where the behavior could be perceived as inappropriate? Is the behavior simply so far removed from the user’s normal routine that its strangeness is off-putting?
> 
> These factors will differ by person and context; therefore, designers should ask, “What is the thing that is missing that would allow my users to proceed to the next step?” Designing with an eye toward simplifying the overall user experience reduces friction, removes obstacles, and helps push the user across Fogg’s action line.
> 
> The action phase of the Hook Model incorporates Fogg’s six elements of simplicity by asking designers to consider how their technology can facilitate the simplest actions in anticipation of reward. The easier an action, the more likely the user is to do it and to continue the cycle through the next phase of the Hook Model.

> 
> Traditionally, registering for a new account with an app or Web site requires several steps. The user is prompted to enter an e-mail address, create a password, and submit other information such as a name or phone number. This burden introduces significant friction that discourages users from signing up. Mobile devices present the special challenge of smaller screens and slower typing speeds.
> 
> However, today it is nearly impossible to browse the web or use a mobile app without encountering a Facebook Login prompt (figure 8). Many companies have eliminated several steps in the registration process by enabling users to register with their sites via their existing Facebook credentials.
> 
> ...
> 
> To ease the way for link sharing, Twitter created an embeddable Tweet button for third-party sites, allowing them to offer visitors a one-click way to tweet directly from their pages. The external trigger opens a preset message, reducing the cognitive effort of composing the tweet and saving several steps to sharing.
> 
> Google, the world’s most popular search engine, was not the first to market. When it launched in the late 1990s, it competed against incumbents such as Yahoo!, Lycos, AltaVista, and Excite. How did Google come to dominate the multibillion-dollar industry?
> 
> For starters, Google’s PageRank algorithm proved to be a much more effective way to index the web. By ranking pages based on how frequently other sites linked to them, Google improved search relevancy. Compared with directory-based search tools such as Yahoo!, Google was a massive time-saver. Google also beat out other search engines that had become polluted with irrelevant content and cluttered with advertising. From its inception, Google’s clean, simple home page and search results pages were solely focused on streamlining the act of searching and getting relevant results.
> 
> Simply put, Google reduced the amount of time and the cognitive effort required to find what the user was looking for. The company continues to relentlessly improve its search engine by finding new ways to remove whatever might be in the user’s way—no matter how seemingly trivial. While its home page remains remarkably pristine, Google now offers myriad tools to make searching easier and faster—including automatic spelling correction, predictive results based on partial queries, and search results that load even as the user is typing. Google’s efforts are intended to make searching easier to keep users coming back.
