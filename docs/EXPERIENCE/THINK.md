# Don't Make Me Think

© 2014 Steve Krug

## Chapter 1. Don't make me think!

> I could list dozens of things that users shouldn’t spend their time thinking about, like
> 
> - Where am I?
>
> - Where should I begin?
>
> - Where did they put _____?
>
> - What are the most important things on this page?
>
> - Why did they call it that?
>
> - Is that an ad or part of the site?
>
> But the last thing you need is another checklist to add to your stack of design checklists. The most important thing you can do is to understand the basic principle of eliminating question marks. When you do, you’ll begin to notice all the things that make you think in the sites and apps you use. And eventually you’ll learn to recognize and avoid them in the things you’re building.
> 
> Your goal should be for each page or screen to be self-evident, so that just by looking at it the average user2 will know what it is and how to use it. In other words, they’ll “get it” without having to think about it.

## Chapter 2. How we really use the Web

> In all the time I’ve spent watching people use the Web, the thing that has struck me most is the difference between how we think people use Web sites and how they actually use them.
> 
> When we’re creating sites, we act as though people are going to pore over each page, reading all of our carefully crafted text, figuring out how we’ve organized things, and weighing their options before deciding which link to click.
> 
> What they actually do most of the time (if we’re lucky) is _glance_ at each new page, scan _some_ of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they’re looking for. There are almost always large parts of the page that they don’t even look at.
>
> ...
> 
> **We don't read pages. We scan them.**
> 
> One of the very few well-documented facts about Web use is that people tend to spend very little time reading most Web pages. Instead, we scan (or skim) them, looking for words or phrases that catch our eye.
> 
> ...
> 
> Like Ginger, we tend to focus on words and phrases that seem to match the task at hand or our current or ongoing personal interests. And of course, (c) the trigger words that are hardwired into our nervous systems, like “Free,” “Sale,” and “Sex,” and our own name.
> 
> ...
> 
> **We don’t make optimal choices. We satisfice.**
> 
> ...
> 
> In reality, though, most of the time we _don’t_ choose the best option—we choose the _first reasonable option_, a strategy known as satisficing.1 As soon as we find a link that seems like it might lead to what we’re looking for, there’s a very good chance that we’ll click it.
> 
> ...
> 
> **We don’t figure out how things work. We muddle through**
> 
> ...
> 
> Faced with any sort of technology, very few people take the time to read instructions. Instead, we forge ahead and muddle through, making up our own vaguely plausible stories about what we’re doing and why it works.

## Chapter 3. Billboard Design 101

> Faced with the fact that your users are whizzing by, there are some important things you can do to make sure they see and understand as much of what they need to know—and of what you want them to know—as possible:
> 
> - Take advantage of conventions
> 
> - Create effective visual hierarchies
> 
> - Break pages up into clearly defined areas
> 
> - Make it obvious what’s clickable
> 
> - Eliminate distractions
> 
> - Format content to support scanning
> 
> ...
> 
> In the past twenty years, many conventions for Web pages have evolved. As users, we’ve come to have a lot of expectations about
> 
> - **Where things will be located on a page.** For example, users expect the logo identifying the site to be in the top-left corner (at least in countries where reading is left-to-right) and the primary navigation to be across the top or down the left side.
> 
> - **How things work.** For example, almost all sites that sell products use the metaphor of a shopping cart and a very similar series of forms for specifying things like your method of payment, your shipping address, and so on.
>
> - **How things look.** Many elements have a standardized appearance, like the icon that tells you it’s a link to a video, the search icon, and the social networking sharing options.
> 
> ...
> 
> The rule of thumb is that you can—and _should_—be as creative and innovative as you want, and add as much aesthetic appeal as you can, _as long as you make sure it’s still usable_.
>
> ...
> 
> **Keep the noise down to a dull roar**
> 
> One of the great enemies of easy-to-grasp pages is visual noise.
>
> Users have varying tolerances for complexity and distractions; some people have no problem with noisy pages, but many find them downright annoying. Users have even been known to put Post-its on their screen to cover up animation that’s distracting them while they’re trying to read.
>
> There are really three different kinds of noise:
>
> - **Shouting.** When everything on the page is clamoring for your attention, the effect can be overwhelming: Lots of invitations to buy! Lots of exclamation points, different typefaces, and bright colors! Automated slideshows, animation, pop-ups, and the never-ending array of new attention-grabbing ad formats!
>
> The truth is, _everything_ can’t be important. Shouting is usually the result of a failure to make tough decisions about which elements are really the most important and then create a visual hierarchy that guides users to them first.
> 
> - **Disorganization.** Some pages look like a room that’s been ransacked, with things strewn everywhere. This is a sure sign that the designer doesn’t understand the importance of using grids to align the elements on a page.
>
> - **Clutter.** We’ve all seen pages—especially Home pages—that just have too much _stuff_. The net effect is the same as when your email inbox is flooded with things like newsletters from sites that have decided that your one contact with them has made you lifelong friends: It’s hard to find and focus on the messages you actually care about. You end up with what engineers call a low signal-to-noise ratio: Lots of noise, not much information, and the noise obscures the useful stuff.
>
> When you’re editing your Web pages, it’s probably a good idea to start with the assumption that _everything_ is visual noise (the “presumed guilty until proven innocent” approach) and get rid of anything that’s not making a real contribution. In the face of limited time and attention, everything that’s not part of the solution must go.

## Chapter 4. Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral?

> I think the rule of thumb might be something like “three mindless, unambiguous clicks equal one click that requires thought.”
> 
> ...
> 
> It was the feeling I get when I’m standing in front of two mailboxes labeled Stamped Mail and Metered Mail with a business reply card in my hand. What do they think it is—stamped or metered? And what happens if I drop it in the wrong box?
> 
> ...
> 
> This problem of giving the user difficult choices and questions that are hard to answer happens all the time in forms.
> 
> ...
> 
> When you can’t avoid giving me a difficult choice, you need to go out of your way to give me as much guidance as I need—but no more.
> 
> This guidance works best when it’s
>
> - Brief: The smallest amount of information that will help me
>
> - Timely: Placed so I encounter it exactly when I need it
>
> - Unavoidable: Formatted in a way that ensures that I’ll notice it

## Chapter 5. Omit Needless Words

> Of the five or six things that I learned in college, the one that has stuck with me the longest—and benefited me the most—is E. B. White’s seventeenth rule in _The Elements of Style_:
> 
>   **17. Omit needless words.**
>   
>   _Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts._
>
> When I look at most Web pages, I’m struck by the fact that most of the words I see are just taking up space, because no one is ever going to read them. And just by being there, all the extra words suggest that you may actually _need_ to read them to understand what’s going on, which often makes pages seem more daunting than they actually are.
> 
> Getting rid of all those words that no one is going to read has several beneficial effects:
> 
> - It reduces the noise level of the page.
> - It makes the useful content more prominent.
> - It makes the pages shorter, allowing users to see more of each page at a glance without scrolling.
> 
> ...
> 
> Your objective should always be to eliminate instructions entirely by making everything self-explanatory, or as close to it as possible. When instructions are absolutely necessary, cut them back to the bare minimum.

Based on the advice from _Design of Everyday Things_, it's best to use affordances instead of copious instructions. Usually too many instructions may mean that the user experience requires improvement.

## Chapter 6. Street Signs and Breadcrumbs

> Persistent navigation should include the four elements you most need to have on hand at all times:
> 
> ![XYZ Corp. Navigation Bar](/.attachments/xyz.corp.nav.bar.png)
> 
> ...
> 
> On pages where a form needs to be filled in, the persistent navigation can sometimes be an unnecessary distraction. For instance, when I’m paying for my purchases on an e-commerce site, you don’t really want me to do anything but finish filling in the forms. The same is true when I’m registering, subscribing, giving feedback, or checking off personalization preferences.
>
> For these pages, it’s useful to have a minimal version of the persistent navigation with just the Site ID, a link to Home, and any Utilities that might help me fill out the form.
> 
> ...
>
> As a rule, the persistent navigation can accommodate only four or five Utilities—the ones users are likely to need most often. If you try to squeeze in more than that, they tend to get lost in the crowd. The less frequently used leftovers belong in the footer: the small text links at the bottom of each page.
> 
> ...
> 
> Almost all Web users expect the Site ID to be a button that can take you to the Home page. I think it’s also a good idea to include Home with the main sections of the site.
> 
> ...
> 
> Given the power of searching and the number of people who prefer searching to browsing, unless a site is very small and very well organized, every page should have either a search box or a link to a search page. And unless there’s very little reason to search your site, it should be a search box.
> 
> ...
> 
> It’s happened so often I’ve come to expect it: When designers I haven’t worked with before send me preliminary page designs so I can check for usability issues, I almost inevitably get a flowchart that shows a site four levels deep…
> 
> I keep flipping the pages looking for more, or at least for the place where they’ve scrawled “Some magic happens here,” but I never find even that. I think this is one of the most common problems in Web design (especially in larger sites): failing to give the lower-level navigation the same attention as the top. In so many sites, as soon as you get past the second level, the navigation breaks down and becomes _ad hoc_. The problem is so common that it’s actually hard to find good examples of third-level navigation.
> 
> ...
> 
> Imagine that you’ve been blindfolded and locked in the trunk of a car, then driven around for a while and dumped on a page somewhere deep in the bowels of a Web site. If the page is well designed, when your vision clears you should be able to answer these questions without hesitation:
> 
> - What site is this? (Site ID)
> 
> - What page am I on? (Page name)
> 
> - What are the major sections of this site? (Sections)
> 
> - What are my options at this level? (Local navigation)
> 
> - Where am I in the scheme of things? (“You are here” indicators)
> 
> - How can I search?

## Chapter 7. The Big Bang Theory of Web Design

> Think about all the things the Home page has to accommodate:
>
> - **Site identity and mission.** Right off the bat, the Home page has to tell me what site this is and what it’s for—and if possible, why I should be here and not at some other site.
>
> - **Site hierarchy.** The Home page has to give an overview of what the site has to offer—both content (“What can I find here?”) and features (“What can I do here?”)—and how it’s all organized. This is usually handled by the persistent navigation.
>
> - **Search.** Most sites need to have a prominently displayed search box on the Home page.
>
> - **Teases.** Like the cover of a magazine, the Home page needs to entice me with hints of the “good stuff” inside.
>
> - **Content promos** spotlight the newest, best, or most popular pieces of content, like top stories and hot deals.
>
> - **Feature promos** invite me to explore additional sections of the site or try out features.
>
> - **Timely content.** If the site’s success depends on my coming back often, the Home page probably needs to have some content that gets updated frequently. And even a site that doesn’t need regular visitors needs some signs of life—even if only a link to a recent press release—to signal to me that it’s not abandoned or hopelessly outdated.
>
> - **Deals.** Home page space needs to be allocated for whatever advertising, cross-promotion, and co-branding deals have been made.
>
> - **Shortcuts.** The most frequently requested pieces of content (software updates, for instance) may deserve their own links on the Home page so that people don’t have to hunt for them.
>
> - **Registration.** If the site uses registration, the Home page needs links or text boxes for new users to register and old users to sign in and a way to let me know that I’m signed in (“Welcome back, Steve Krug”).
>
> In addition to these concrete needs, the Home page also has to meet a few abstract objectives:
> 
> - **Show me what I’m looking for.** The Home page needs to make it obvious how to get to whatever I want—assuming it’s somewhere on the site.
> 
> - **...and what I’m not looking for.** At the same time, the Home page needs to expose me to some of the wonderful things the site has to offer that I might be interested in—even though I’m not actively looking for them.
> 
> - **Show me where to start.** There’s nothing worse than encountering a new Home page and having no idea where to begin.
> 
> - **Establish credibility and trust.** For some visitors, the Home page will be the only chance your site gets to create a good impression.
> 
> ...
> 
> As a result, the Home page is the waterfront property of the Web: It’s the most desirable real estate, and there’s a very limited supply. Everybody who has a stake in the site wants a promo or a link to their section on the Home page, and the turf battles for Home page visibility can be fierce.
> 
> ...
> 
> The one thing you can’t afford to lose in the shuffle—and the thing that most often gets lost—is **conveying the big picture**. Whenever someone hands me a Home page design to look at, there’s one thing I can almost always count on: They haven’t made it clear enough _what the site is_.
> 
> ...
> 
> I need to be able to answer these questions at a glance, correctly and unambiguously, with very little effort.
>
> If it’s not clear to me what I’m looking at in the first few seconds, interpreting everything else on the page is harder, and the chances are greater that I’ll misinterpret something and get frustrated.
> 
> ...
> 
> This is what I call the Big Bang Theory of Web Design. Like _the_ Big Bang Theory it’s based on the idea that the first few seconds you spend on a new Web site or Web page are critical.
> 
> ...
> 
> I know what some of you are thinking:
> 
> “Nobody enters a site through the Home page anymore. That’s so 2004.”
>
> And you’re right, of course. Compared to the early days of the Web, the Home page has lost its preeminence. Now people are just as likely—or more likely—to enter your site by clicking on a link in an email, a blog, or something from a social network that takes them directly to a page deep in your site.
> 
> Because of this, every page of your site should do as much as it can to orient them properly: to give them the right idea about who you are, what you do, and what your site has to offer.
>
> The problem is, though, there’s not much space on most pages to do that well. As a result, many users have formed a new behavior.
>
> People will teleport into the depths of a site and look at the page the link took them to. Very often, though, the next thing they’ll do is visit the Home page to get their bearings. (I like to think of it as divers bobbing up to the surface to see where they are.) If the page they went to was interesting, they want to see what else is on the site. If it contained information they need to rely on, they may want to find out who publishes it, and how credible it is.
> 
> The Home page is still the place where this happens, and you need to do it well.
> 
> ...
> 
> Everything on the Home page can contribute to our understanding of what the site is. But there are three important places on the page where we expect to find explicit statements of what the site is about.
> 
> ![Rezdy Home Page](/.attachments/rezdy.home.page.png) 
>
> - **The tagline.** One of the most valuable bits of real estate is the space right next to the Site ID. When we see a phrase that’s visually connected to the ID, we know it’s meant to be a tagline, and so we read it as a description of the whole site. We’ll look at taglines in detail in the next section.
> 
> - **The Welcome blurb.** The Welcome blurb is a terse description of the site, displayed in a prominent block on the Home page, usually at the top left or center of the content space so it’s the first thing that catches your eye.
> 
> - **The “Learn more.”** Innovative products and business models tend to require a fair amount of explanation, often more than most people have the patience for. But people have become accustomed to watching short videos on their computers and mobile devices. As a result, people have now come to expect a short explanatory video on most sites and are often willing to watch them.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Don’t use a mission statement as a Welcome blurb.** Many sites fill their Home page with their corporate mission statement that sounds like it was written by a Miss America finalist. “XYZCorp offers world-class solutions in the burgeoning field of blah blah blah blah blah....” Nobody reads them.
> 
> ...
> 
> A tagline is a pithy phrase that characterizes the whole enterprise, summing up what it is and what makes it great. Taglines have been around for a long time in advertising, entertainment, and publishing: “Thousands of cars at impossibly low prices,” “More stars than there are in the heavens,”1 and “All the News That’s Fit to Print,”2 for example.
> 
> On a Web site, the tagline appears right below, above, or next to the Site ID.
> 
> Taglines are a very efficient way to get your message across, because they’re the one place on the page where users most expect to find a concise statement of the site’s purpose.
> 
> Some attributes to look for when choosing a tagline:
> 
> - Good taglines are **clear** and **informative** and explain exactly what your site or your organization does.
>
>   ![ZipCar Logo and Tagline](/.attachments/zip.car.png)
> 
> - Good taglines are **just long enough, but not too long**. Six to eight words seem to be long enough to convey a full thought, but short enough to absorb easily.
> 
>   ![Fuel Economy Tagline](/.attachments/fuel.economy.png)
> 
> - Good taglines **convey differentiation** and a clear benefit. Jakob Nielsen has suggested that a really good tagline is one that no one else in the world could use except you, and I think it’s an excellent way to look at it.
> 
> - Bad taglines sound **generic**.
> 
>   ![Netmarket.com](/.attachments/netmarket.com.png)
>   
>   Don’t confuse a tagline with a motto, like “We bring good things to life,” “You’re in good hands,” or “To protect and to serve.” A motto expresses a guiding principle, a goal, or an ideal, but a tagline conveys a value proposition. Mottoes are lofty and reassuring, but if I don’t know what the thing is, a motto isn’t going to tell me.
> 
> - Good taglines are **personable, lively,** and **sometimes clever**. Clever is good, but only if the cleverness helps convey—not obscure—the benefit.
>   
>   ![The Daily Beast](/.attachments/the.daily.beast.png)
> 
>   ![The Breakfast Blog](/.attachments/the.breakfast.blog.png)
> 
> ...
> 
> When I enter a new site, after a quick look around the Home page I should be able to say with confidence:
> 
> - Here’s where to start if I want to search.
> - Here’s where to start if I want to browse.
> - Here’s where to start if I want to sample their best stuff.
> 
> On sites that are built around a step-by-step process (applying for a mortgage, for instance), the entry point for the process should leap out at me. And on sites where I have to register if I’m a new user or sign in if I’m a returning user, the places where I register or sign in should be prominent.
>
> Unfortunately, the need to promote everything (or at least everything that supports this week’s business model) sometimes obscures these entry points. It can be hard to find them when the page is full of promos yelling “Start here!” and “No, click me first!”
> 
> The best way to keep this from happening is to make the entry points look like entry points (i.e., make the search box look like a search box and the list of sections look like a list of sections). It also helps to label them clearly, with labels like “Search,” “Browse by Category,” “Sign in,” and “Start here” (for a step-by-step process).
> 
> Preserving the Home page from promotional overload requires constant vigilance, since it usually happens gradually, with the slow, inexorable addition of just...one...more...thing.
> 
> All the stakeholders need to be educated about the danger of overgrazing the Home page and offered other methods of driving traffic, like cross-promoting from other popular pages or taking turns using the same space on the Home page.

## Chapter 8. "The Farmer and the Cowman Should Be Friends"
