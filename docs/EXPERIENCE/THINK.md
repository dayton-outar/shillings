# Don't Make Me Think

© 2014 Steve Krug

## Chapter 1. Don't make me think!

> I could list dozens of things that users shouldn’t spend their time thinking about, like
> 
> - Where am I?
>
> - Where should I begin?
>
> - Where did they put _____?
>
> - What are the most important things on this page?
>
> - Why did they call it that?
>
> - Is that an ad or part of the site?
>
> But the last thing you need is another checklist to add to your stack of design checklists. The most important thing you can do is to understand the basic principle of eliminating question marks. When you do, you’ll begin to notice all the things that make you think in the sites and apps you use. And eventually you’ll learn to recognize and avoid them in the things you’re building.
> 
> Your goal should be for each page or screen to be self-evident, so that just by looking at it the average user2 will know what it is and how to use it. In other words, they’ll “get it” without having to think about it.

## Chapter 2. How we really use the Web

> In all the time I’ve spent watching people use the Web, the thing that has struck me most is the difference between how we think people use Web sites and how they actually use them.
> 
> When we’re creating sites, we act as though people are going to pore over each page, reading all of our carefully crafted text, figuring out how we’ve organized things, and weighing their options before deciding which link to click.
> 
> What they actually do most of the time (if we’re lucky) is _glance_ at each new page, scan _some_ of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they’re looking for. There are almost always large parts of the page that they don’t even look at.
>
> ...
> 
> **We don't read pages. We scan them.**
> 
> One of the very few well-documented facts about Web use is that people tend to spend very little time reading most Web pages. Instead, we scan (or skim) them, looking for words or phrases that catch our eye.
> 
> ...
> 
> Like Ginger, we tend to focus on words and phrases that seem to match the task at hand or our current or ongoing personal interests. And of course, (c) the trigger words that are hardwired into our nervous systems, like “Free,” “Sale,” and “Sex,” and our own name.
> 
> ...
> 
> **We don’t make optimal choices. We satisfice.**
> 
> ...
> 
> In reality, though, most of the time we _don’t_ choose the best option—we choose the _first reasonable option_, a strategy known as satisficing.1 As soon as we find a link that seems like it might lead to what we’re looking for, there’s a very good chance that we’ll click it.
> 
> ...
> 
> **We don’t figure out how things work. We muddle through**
> 
> ...
> 
> Faced with any sort of technology, very few people take the time to read instructions. Instead, we forge ahead and muddle through, making up our own vaguely plausible stories about what we’re doing and why it works.

## Chapter 3. Billboard Design 101

> Faced with the fact that your users are whizzing by, there are some important things you can do to make sure they see and understand as much of what they need to know—and of what you want them to know—as possible:
> 
> - Take advantage of conventions
> 
> - Create effective visual hierarchies
> 
> - Break pages up into clearly defined areas
> 
> - Make it obvious what’s clickable
> 
> - Eliminate distractions
> 
> - Format content to support scanning
> 
> ...
> 
> In the past twenty years, many conventions for Web pages have evolved. As users, we’ve come to have a lot of expectations about
> 
> - **Where things will be located on a page.** For example, users expect the logo identifying the site to be in the top-left corner (at least in countries where reading is left-to-right) and the primary navigation to be across the top or down the left side.
> 
> - **How things work.** For example, almost all sites that sell products use the metaphor of a shopping cart and a very similar series of forms for specifying things like your method of payment, your shipping address, and so on.
>
> - **How things look.** Many elements have a standardized appearance, like the icon that tells you it’s a link to a video, the search icon, and the social networking sharing options.
> 
> ...
> 
> The rule of thumb is that you can—and _should_—be as creative and innovative as you want, and add as much aesthetic appeal as you can, _as long as you make sure it’s still usable_.
>
> ...
> 
> **Keep the noise down to a dull roar**
> 
> One of the great enemies of easy-to-grasp pages is visual noise.
>
> Users have varying tolerances for complexity and distractions; some people have no problem with noisy pages, but many find them downright annoying. Users have even been known to put Post-its on their screen to cover up animation that’s distracting them while they’re trying to read.
>
> There are really three different kinds of noise:
>
> - **Shouting.** When everything on the page is clamoring for your attention, the effect can be overwhelming: Lots of invitations to buy! Lots of exclamation points, different typefaces, and bright colors! Automated slideshows, animation, pop-ups, and the never-ending array of new attention-grabbing ad formats!
>
> The truth is, _everything_ can’t be important. Shouting is usually the result of a failure to make tough decisions about which elements are really the most important and then create a visual hierarchy that guides users to them first.
> 
> - **Disorganization.** Some pages look like a room that’s been ransacked, with things strewn everywhere. This is a sure sign that the designer doesn’t understand the importance of using grids to align the elements on a page.
>
> - **Clutter.** We’ve all seen pages—especially Home pages—that just have too much _stuff_. The net effect is the same as when your email inbox is flooded with things like newsletters from sites that have decided that your one contact with them has made you lifelong friends: It’s hard to find and focus on the messages you actually care about. You end up with what engineers call a low signal-to-noise ratio: Lots of noise, not much information, and the noise obscures the useful stuff.
>
> When you’re editing your Web pages, it’s probably a good idea to start with the assumption that _everything_ is visual noise (the “presumed guilty until proven innocent” approach) and get rid of anything that’s not making a real contribution. In the face of limited time and attention, everything that’s not part of the solution must go.

## Chapter 4. Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral?

> I think the rule of thumb might be something like “three mindless, unambiguous clicks equal one click that requires thought.”
> 
> ...
> 
> It was the feeling I get when I’m standing in front of two mailboxes labeled Stamped Mail and Metered Mail with a business reply card in my hand. What do they think it is—stamped or metered? And what happens if I drop it in the wrong box?
> 
> ...
> 
> This problem of giving the user difficult choices and questions that are hard to answer happens all the time in forms.
> 
> ...
> 
> When you can’t avoid giving me a difficult choice, you need to go out of your way to give me as much guidance as I need—but no more.
> 
> This guidance works best when it’s
>
> - Brief: The smallest amount of information that will help me
>
> - Timely: Placed so I encounter it exactly when I need it
>
> - Unavoidable: Formatted in a way that ensures that I’ll notice it

## Chapter 5. Omit Needless Words

> Of the five or six things that I learned in college, the one that has stuck with me the longest—and benefited me the most—is E. B. White’s seventeenth rule in _The Elements of Style_:
> 
>   **17. Omit needless words.**
>   
>   _Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts._
>
> When I look at most Web pages, I’m struck by the fact that most of the words I see are just taking up space, because no one is ever going to read them. And just by being there, all the extra words suggest that you may actually _need_ to read them to understand what’s going on, which often makes pages seem more daunting than they actually are.
> 
> Getting rid of all those words that no one is going to read has several beneficial effects:
> 
> - It reduces the noise level of the page.
> - It makes the useful content more prominent.
> - It makes the pages shorter, allowing users to see more of each page at a glance without scrolling.
> 
> ...
> 
> Your objective should always be to eliminate instructions entirely by making everything self-explanatory, or as close to it as possible. When instructions are absolutely necessary, cut them back to the bare minimum.

Based on the advice from _Design of Everyday Things_, it's best to use affordances instead of copious instructions. Usually too many instructions may mean that the user experience requires improvement.

## Chapter 6. Street Signs and Breadcrumbs

> Persistent navigation should include the four elements you most need to have on hand at all times:
> 
> ![XYZ Corp. Navigation Bar](/.attachments/xyz.corp.nav.bar-1.png)
> 
> ...
> 
> On pages where a form needs to be filled in, the persistent navigation can sometimes be an unnecessary distraction. For instance, when I’m paying for my purchases on an e-commerce site, you don’t really want me to do anything but finish filling in the forms. The same is true when I’m registering, subscribing, giving feedback, or checking off personalization preferences.
>
> For these pages, it’s useful to have a minimal version of the persistent navigation with just the Site ID, a link to Home, and any Utilities that might help me fill out the form.
> 
> ...
>
> As a rule, the persistent navigation can accommodate only four or five Utilities—the ones users are likely to need most often. If you try to squeeze in more than that, they tend to get lost in the crowd. The less frequently used leftovers belong in the footer: the small text links at the bottom of each page.
> 
> ...
> 
> Almost all Web users expect the Site ID to be a button that can take you to the Home page. I think it’s also a good idea to include Home with the main sections of the site.
> 
> ...
> 
> Given the power of searching and the number of people who prefer searching to browsing, unless a site is very small and very well organized, every page should have either a search box or a link to a search page. And unless there’s very little reason to search your site, it should be a search box.
> 
> ...
> 
> It’s happened so often I’ve come to expect it: When designers I haven’t worked with before send me preliminary page designs so I can check for usability issues, I almost inevitably get a flowchart that shows a site four levels deep…
> 
> I keep flipping the pages looking for more, or at least for the place where they’ve scrawled “Some magic happens here,” but I never find even that. I think this is one of the most common problems in Web design (especially in larger sites): failing to give the lower-level navigation the same attention as the top. In so many sites, as soon as you get past the second level, the navigation breaks down and becomes _ad hoc_. The problem is so common that it’s actually hard to find good examples of third-level navigation.
> 
> ...
> 
> Imagine that you’ve been blindfolded and locked in the trunk of a car, then driven around for a while and dumped on a page somewhere deep in the bowels of a Web site. If the page is well designed, when your vision clears you should be able to answer these questions without hesitation:
> 
> - What site is this? (Site ID)
> 
> - What page am I on? (Page name)
> 
> - What are the major sections of this site? (Sections)
> 
> - What are my options at this level? (Local navigation)
> 
> - Where am I in the scheme of things? (“You are here” indicators)
> 
> - How can I search?

## Chapter 7. The Big Bang Theory of Web Design

> Think about all the things the Home page has to accommodate:
>
> - **Site identity and mission.** Right off the bat, the Home page has to tell me what site this is and what it’s for—and if possible, why I should be here and not at some other site.
>
> - **Site hierarchy.** The Home page has to give an overview of what the site has to offer—both content (“What can I find here?”) and features (“What can I do here?”)—and how it’s all organized. This is usually handled by the persistent navigation.
>
> - **Search.** Most sites need to have a prominently displayed search box on the Home page.
>
> - **Teases.** Like the cover of a magazine, the Home page needs to entice me with hints of the “good stuff” inside.
>
> - **Content promos** spotlight the newest, best, or most popular pieces of content, like top stories and hot deals.
>
> - **Feature promos** invite me to explore additional sections of the site or try out features.
>
> - **Timely content.** If the site’s success depends on my coming back often, the Home page probably needs to have some content that gets updated frequently. And even a site that doesn’t need regular visitors needs some signs of life—even if only a link to a recent press release—to signal to me that it’s not abandoned or hopelessly outdated.
>
> - **Deals.** Home page space needs to be allocated for whatever advertising, cross-promotion, and co-branding deals have been made.
>
> - **Shortcuts.** The most frequently requested pieces of content (software updates, for instance) may deserve their own links on the Home page so that people don’t have to hunt for them.
>
> - **Registration.** If the site uses registration, the Home page needs links or text boxes for new users to register and old users to sign in and a way to let me know that I’m signed in (“Welcome back, Steve Krug”).
>
> In addition to these concrete needs, the Home page also has to meet a few abstract objectives:
> 
> - **Show me what I’m looking for.** The Home page needs to make it obvious how to get to whatever I want—assuming it’s somewhere on the site.
> 
> - **...and what I’m not looking for.** At the same time, the Home page needs to expose me to some of the wonderful things the site has to offer that I might be interested in—even though I’m not actively looking for them.
> 
> - **Show me where to start.** There’s nothing worse than encountering a new Home page and having no idea where to begin.
> 
> - **Establish credibility and trust.** For some visitors, the Home page will be the only chance your site gets to create a good impression.
> 
> ...
> 
> As a result, the Home page is the waterfront property of the Web: It’s the most desirable real estate, and there’s a very limited supply. Everybody who has a stake in the site wants a promo or a link to their section on the Home page, and the turf battles for Home page visibility can be fierce.
> 
> ...
> 
> The one thing you can’t afford to lose in the shuffle—and the thing that most often gets lost—is **conveying the big picture**. Whenever someone hands me a Home page design to look at, there’s one thing I can almost always count on: They haven’t made it clear enough _what the site is_.
> 
> ...
> 
> I need to be able to answer these questions at a glance, correctly and unambiguously, with very little effort.
>
> If it’s not clear to me what I’m looking at in the first few seconds, interpreting everything else on the page is harder, and the chances are greater that I’ll misinterpret something and get frustrated.
> 
> ...
> 
> This is what I call the Big Bang Theory of Web Design. Like _the_ Big Bang Theory it’s based on the idea that the first few seconds you spend on a new Web site or Web page are critical.
> 
> ...
> 
> I know what some of you are thinking:
> 
> “Nobody enters a site through the Home page anymore. That’s so 2004.”
>
> And you’re right, of course. Compared to the early days of the Web, the Home page has lost its preeminence. Now people are just as likely—or more likely—to enter your site by clicking on a link in an email, a blog, or something from a social network that takes them directly to a page deep in your site.
> 
> Because of this, every page of your site should do as much as it can to orient them properly: to give them the right idea about who you are, what you do, and what your site has to offer.
>
> The problem is, though, there’s not much space on most pages to do that well. As a result, many users have formed a new behavior.
>
> People will teleport into the depths of a site and look at the page the link took them to. Very often, though, the next thing they’ll do is visit the Home page to get their bearings. (I like to think of it as divers bobbing up to the surface to see where they are.) If the page they went to was interesting, they want to see what else is on the site. If it contained information they need to rely on, they may want to find out who publishes it, and how credible it is.
> 
> The Home page is still the place where this happens, and you need to do it well.
> 
> ...
> 
> Everything on the Home page can contribute to our understanding of what the site is. But there are three important places on the page where we expect to find explicit statements of what the site is about.
> 
> ![Rezdy Home Page](/.attachments/rezdy.home.page.png) 
>
> - **The tagline.** One of the most valuable bits of real estate is the space right next to the Site ID. When we see a phrase that’s visually connected to the ID, we know it’s meant to be a tagline, and so we read it as a description of the whole site. We’ll look at taglines in detail in the next section.
> 
> - **The Welcome blurb.** The Welcome blurb is a terse description of the site, displayed in a prominent block on the Home page, usually at the top left or center of the content space so it’s the first thing that catches your eye.
> 
> - **The “Learn more.”** Innovative products and business models tend to require a fair amount of explanation, often more than most people have the patience for. But people have become accustomed to watching short videos on their computers and mobile devices. As a result, people have now come to expect a short explanatory video on most sites and are often willing to watch them.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Don’t use a mission statement as a Welcome blurb.** Many sites fill their Home page with their corporate mission statement that sounds like it was written by a Miss America finalist. “XYZCorp offers world-class solutions in the burgeoning field of blah blah blah blah blah....” Nobody reads them.
> 
> ...
> 
> A tagline is a pithy phrase that characterizes the whole enterprise, summing up what it is and what makes it great. Taglines have been around for a long time in advertising, entertainment, and publishing: “Thousands of cars at impossibly low prices,” “More stars than there are in the heavens,”1 and “All the News That’s Fit to Print,”2 for example.
> 
> On a Web site, the tagline appears right below, above, or next to the Site ID.
> 
> Taglines are a very efficient way to get your message across, because they’re the one place on the page where users most expect to find a concise statement of the site’s purpose.
> 
> Some attributes to look for when choosing a tagline:
> 
> - Good taglines are **clear** and **informative** and explain exactly what your site or your organization does.
>
>   ![ZipCar Logo and Tagline](/.attachments/zip.car.png)
> 
> - Good taglines are **just long enough, but not too long**. Six to eight words seem to be long enough to convey a full thought, but short enough to absorb easily.
> 
>   ![Fuel Economy Tagline](/.attachments/fuel.economy.png)
> 
> - Good taglines **convey differentiation** and a clear benefit. Jakob Nielsen has suggested that a really good tagline is one that no one else in the world could use except you, and I think it’s an excellent way to look at it.
> 
> - Bad taglines sound **generic**.
> 
>   ![Netmarket.com](/.attachments/netmarket.com.png)
>   
>   Don’t confuse a tagline with a motto, like “We bring good things to life,” “You’re in good hands,” or “To protect and to serve.” A motto expresses a guiding principle, a goal, or an ideal, but a tagline conveys a value proposition. Mottoes are lofty and reassuring, but if I don’t know what the thing is, a motto isn’t going to tell me.
> 
> - Good taglines are **personable, lively,** and **sometimes clever**. Clever is good, but only if the cleverness helps convey—not obscure—the benefit.
>   
>   ![The Daily Beast](/.attachments/the.daily.beast.png)
> 
>   ![The Breakfast Blog](/.attachments/the.breakfast.blog.png)
> 
> ...
> 
> When I enter a new site, after a quick look around the Home page I should be able to say with confidence:
> 
> - Here’s where to start if I want to search.
> - Here’s where to start if I want to browse.
> - Here’s where to start if I want to sample their best stuff.
> 
> On sites that are built around a step-by-step process (applying for a mortgage, for instance), the entry point for the process should leap out at me. And on sites where I have to register if I’m a new user or sign in if I’m a returning user, the places where I register or sign in should be prominent.
>
> Unfortunately, the need to promote everything (or at least everything that supports this week’s business model) sometimes obscures these entry points. It can be hard to find them when the page is full of promos yelling “Start here!” and “No, click me first!”
> 
> The best way to keep this from happening is to make the entry points look like entry points (i.e., make the search box look like a search box and the list of sections look like a list of sections). It also helps to label them clearly, with labels like “Search,” “Browse by Category,” “Sign in,” and “Start here” (for a step-by-step process).
> 
> Preserving the Home page from promotional overload requires constant vigilance, since it usually happens gradually, with the slow, inexorable addition of just...one...more...thing.
> 
> All the stakeholders need to be educated about the danger of overgrazing the Home page and offered other methods of driving traffic, like cross-promoting from other popular pages or taking turns using the same space on the Home page.

## Chapter 8. "The Farmer and the Cowman Should Be Friends"

> The point is, it’s not productive to ask questions like “Do most people like pull-down menus?” The right kind of question to ask is “Does this pull-down, with these items and this wording in this context on this page create a good experience for most people who are likely to use this site?”
> And there’s really only one way to answer that kind of question: testing. You have to use the collective skill, experience, creativity, and common sense of the team to build some version of the thing (even a crude version), then watch some people carefully as they try to figure out what it is and how to use it.
> 
> There’s no substitute for it.

## Chapter 9. Usability Testing on 10 Cents a Day

> After each round of tests, you should make time as soon as possible for the team to share their observations and decide which problems to fix and what you’re going to do to fix them.
> 
> ...
> 
> Whenever you test, you’re almost always going to find some serious usability problems. Unfortunately, they aren’t always the ones that get fixed. Often, for instance, people will say, “Yes, that’s a real problem. But that functionality is all going to change soon, and we can live with it until then.” Or faced with a choice between trying to fix one serious problem or a lot of simple problems, they opt for the low-hanging fruit.

## Chapter 10. Mobile: It's not just a city in Alabama anymore

> So, what’s different about usability when you’re designing for use on a mobile device?
>
> In one sense, the answer is: Not much. The basic principles are still the same. If anything, people are moving faster and reading even less on small screens.
>
> But there are _some_ significant differences about mobile that make for challenging new usability problems.
> 
> ...
> 
> The most obvious thing about mobile screens is that they’re small. For decades, we’ve been designing for screens which, while they may have felt small to Web designers at the time, were luxurious by today’s standards. And even then, designers were working overtime trying to squeeze everything into view.
> 
> One approach was Mobile First. Instead of designing a full-featured (and perhaps bloated) version of your Web site first and then paring it down to create the mobile version, you design the mobile version first based on the features and content that are most important to your users. Then you add on more features and content to create the desktop/full version.
> 
> It was a great idea. For one thing, Mobile First meant that you would work hard to determine what was really essential, what people needed most. Always a good thing to do.
> 
> But some people interpreted it to mean that you should choose what to include based on what people want to do when they’re mobile. This assumed that when people accessed the mobile version they were “on the move,” not sitting at their desk, so they’d only need the kinds of features you’d use on the move. For example, you might want to check your bank balances while out shopping, but you wouldn’t be likely to reconcile your checkbook or set up a new account.
> 
> Of course, it turned out this was wrong. People are just as likely to be using their mobile devices while sitting on the couch at home, and they want (and expect) to be able to do everything. Or at least, everybody wants to do _some_ things, and if you add them all up it amounts to everything.
> 
> If you’re going to include everything, you have to pay even more attention to prioritizing.
> 
> Things I want to use in a hurry or frequently should be close at hand. Everything else can be a few taps away, but there should be an obvious path to get to them.
> 
> In some cases, the lack of space on each screen means that mobile sites become much deeper than their full-size cousins, so you might have to tap down three, four, or five “levels” to get to some features or content.
> 
> This means that people will be tapping more, but that’s OK. With small screens it’s inevitable: To see the same amount of information, you’re going to be either tapping or scrolling a lot more. As long as the user continues to feel confident that what they want is further down the screen or behind that link or button, they’ll keep going.
> 
> ...
> 
> Affordances are visual clues in an object’s design that suggest how we can use it. ... Remember the doorknobs and the book
by Don Norman? He popularized the term in the first edition of _The Design of Everyday Things_ in 1988 and the design world quickly adopted it.
> 
> Affordances are the meat and potatoes of a visual user interface. For instance, the three-dimensional style of some buttons makes it clear they’re meant to be clicked. The same as with the scent of information for links, the clearer the visual cues, the more unambiguous the signal.
> 
> For affordances to work, they need to be noticeable, and some characteristics of mobile devices have made them less noticeable or, worse, invisible. And by definition, affordances are the _last_ thing you should hide.

## Chapter 11. Usability as Common Courtesy

> Here are a few of the things that tend to make users feel like the people publishing a site don’t have their best interests at heart:
> 
> **Hiding information that I want.** The most common things to hide are customer support phone numbers, shipping rates, and prices.
> 
> The whole point of hiding support phone numbers is to try to keep users from calling, because each call costs money. The usual effect is to diminish goodwill and ensure that they’ll be even more annoyed when they do find the number and call. On the other hand, if the 800 number is in plain sight—perhaps even on every page—somehow knowing that they can call if they want to is often enough to keep people looking for the information on the site longer, increasing the chances that they’ll solve the problem themselves.
> 
> Some sites hide pricing information in hopes of getting users so far into the process that they’ll feel vested in it by the time they experience the sticker shock. My favorite example is Web sites for wireless access in public places like airports. Having seen a “Wireless access available!” sign and knowing that it’s free at some airports, you open up your laptop, find a signal, and try to connect. But then you have to scan, read, and click your way through three pages, following links like “Wireless Access” and “Click here to connect” before you get to a page that even hints at what it might cost you. It feels like an old phone sales tactic: If they can just keep you on the line long enough and keep throwing more of their marketing pitch at you, maybe they can convince you along the way.
> 
> **Punishing me for not doing things your way.** I should _never_ have to think about formatting data: whether or not to put dashes in my Social Security number, spaces in my credit card number, or parentheses in my phone number. Many sites perversely insist on no spaces in credit card numbers, when the spaces actually make it much easier to type the number correctly. Don’t make me jump through hoops just because you don’t want to write a little bit of code.
> 
> **Asking me for information you don’t really need.** Most users are very skeptical of requests for personal information and find it annoying if a site asks for more than what’s needed for the task at hand.
> 
> **Shucking and jiving me.** We’re always on the lookout for faux sincerity, and disingenuous attempts to convince me that you care about me can be particularly annoying. Think about what goes through your head every time you hear “Your call is important to us.”
> 
> **Putting sizzle in my way.** Having to wade through pages bloated with feel-good marketing photos makes it clear that you don’t understand—or care—that I’m in a hurry.
> 
> **Your site looks amateurish.** You can lose goodwill if your site looks sloppy, disorganized, or unprofessional, like no effort has gone into making it presentable.
> 
> Note that while people love to make comments about the appearance of sites—especially about whether they like the colors—almost no one is going to leave a site just because it doesn’t look great. (I tell people to ignore all comments that users make about colors during a user test, unless three out of four people use a word like “puke” to describe the color scheme. Then it’s worth rethinking.)
> 
> ...
> 
> The good news is that even if you make mistakes, it’s possible to restore my goodwill by doing things that convince me that you _do_ have my interests at heart. Most of these are just the flip side of the other list:
> 
> **Know the main things that people want to do on your site and make them obvious and easy.** It’s usually not hard to figure out what people want to do on a given Web site. I find that even people who disagree about everything else about their organization’s site almost always give me the same answer when I ask them, “What are the three main things your users want to do?” The problem is, making those things easy doesn’t always become the top priority it should be. (If most people are coming to your site to apply for a mortgage, nothing should get in the way of making it dead easy to apply for a mortgage.)
> 
> **Tell me what I want to know.** Be upfront about things like shipping costs, hotel daily parking fees, service outages—anything you’d rather _not_ be upfront about. You may lose points if your shipping rates are higher than I’d like, but you’ll often gain enough points for candor and for making it easy for me to compensate for the price difference.
> 
> **Save me steps wherever you can.** For instance, instead of giving me the shipping company’s tracking number for my purchase, put a link in my email receipt that opens their site and submits my tracking number when I click it. (As usual, Amazon was the first site to do this for me.)
> 
> **Put effort into it.** My favorite example is the HP technical support site, where it seems like an enormous amount of work has gone into (a) generating the information I need to solve my problems, (b) making sure that it’s accurate and useful, (c) presenting it clearly, and (d) organizing it so I can find it. I’ve had a lot of HP printers, and in almost every case where I’ve had a problem I’ve been able to solve it on my own. As a result, I keep buying HP printers.
> 
> **Know what questions I’m likely to have, and answer them.** Frequently Asked Questions lists are enormously valuable, especially if
> 
> - They really are FAQs, not marketing pitches masquerading as FAQs (also known as QWWPWAs: Questions We _Wish_ People Would Ask).
> 
> - You keep them up to date. Customer Service and Technical Support can easily give you a list of this week’s five most frequently asked questions. I would always put this list at the top of any site’s Support page.
> 
> - They’re candid. Often people are looking in the FAQs for the answer to a question you’d rather they hadn’t asked. Candor in these situations goes a _long_ way to increasing goodwill.
> 
> **Provide me with creature comforts like printer-friendly pages.** Some people love being able to print stories that span multiple pages with a single click, and CSS makes it relatively easy to create printer-friendly pages with little additional effort. Drop the ads (the possibility of a banner ad having any impact other than being annoying is even greater when it’s just taking up space on paper), but _don’t_ drop the illustrations, photos, and figures.
> 
> **Make it easy to recover from errors.** If you actually do enough user testing, you’ll be able to spare me from many errors before they happen. But where the potential for errors is unavoidable, always provide a graceful, obvious way for me to recover.
> 
> **When in doubt, apologize.** Sometimes you can’t help it: You just don’t have the ability or resources to do what the user wants (for instance, your university’s library system requires separate passwords for each of your catalog databases, so you can’t give users the single login they’d like). If you can’t do what they want, at least let them know that you know you’re inconveniencing them.

## Chapter 12. Accessibility and You

> Unfortunately, there’s also a lot that’s unlikely to convince 22-year-old developers and designers that they should be “doing accessibility.” Two arguments in particular tend to make them skeptical:
> 
> - **___% of the population has a disability.** Since their world consists largely of able-bodied 22-year-olds, it’s very hard for them to believe that a large percentage of the population actually needs help accessing the Web. They’re willing to write it off as the kind of exaggeration that people make when they’re advocating for a worthy cause, but there’s also a natural inclination to think, “If one of their claims is so clearly untrue, I’m entitled to be skeptical about the rest.”
> 
> - **Making things more accessible benefits everyone.** They know that some adaptations do, like the classic example, closed captioning, which does often come in handy for people who can hear.2 But since this always seems to be the only example cited, it feels a little like arguing that the space program was worthwhile because it gave us Tang.3 It’s much easier for developers and designers to imagine cases where accessibility adaptations are likely to make things worse for “everyone else.”
> 
> The worst thing about this skepticism is that it obscures the fact that there’s really only one reason that’s important:
> 
> - **It’s the right thing to do.** And not just the right thing; it’s profoundly the right thing to do, because the one argument for accessibility that doesn’t get made nearly often enough is how extraordinarily better it makes some people’s lives. Personally, I don’t think anyone should need more than this one example: Blind people with access to a computer can now read almost any newspaper or magazine on their own. Imagine that.
> 
> How many opportunities do we have to dramatically improve people’s lives just by doing our job a little better?
> 
> ...
> 
> Now you’re ready to do what most people think of as Web accessibility: implementing specific changes in your pages.
>
> As of right now, these are probably the most important things to do:
> 
> - **Add appropriate alt text to every image.** Add an empty (or “null”) alt attribute (<alt="">) for images that screen readers should ignore, and add helpful, descriptive text for the rest.
> 
> To learn how to write good alt text—and in fact to learn how to do any of the things in this list—head over to webaim.org. The folks at WebAIM have written excellent practical articles covering the nuts-and-bolts details of almost every accessibility technique.
> 
> - **Use headings correctly.** The standard HTML heading elements convey useful information about the logical organization of your content to people using screen readers and make it easier for them to navigate via the keyboard. Use `<h1>` for the page title or main content heading, `<h2>` for the major section headings, `<h3>` for subheadings, and so on, and then use CSS to redefine the visual appearance of each level.
> 
> - **Make your forms work with screen readers.** This largely boils down to using the HTML `<label>` element to associate the fields with their text labels, so people know what they’re supposed to enter.
> 
> - **Put a “Skip to Main Content” link at the beginning of each page.** Imagine having to spend 20 seconds (or a minute, or two) listening to the
global navigation at the top of every page before you could look at the content, and you’ll understand why this is important.
> 
> - **Make all content accessible by keyboard.** Remember, not everyone can use a mouse.
> 
> - **Create significant contrast between your text and background.** Don’t ever use light grey text on a dark grey background, for instance.
> 
> - **Use an accessible template.** If you’re using WordPress, for example, make sure that the theme you choose has been designed to be accessible.
> 
> That’s it. You’ll probably learn how to do a lot more as you go along, but even if you do only what I’ve covered here, you’ll have made a really good start.

## Chapter 13. Guide for the Perplexed

> Back in the late 1990s, Usability and User Centered Design (UCD) were the terms most people used to describe any efforts to design with the user in mind. And there were essentially two “professions” that focused on making Web sites more usable: Usability (making sure things are designed in a way that enables people to use them successfully) and Information Architecture (making sure the content is organized in a way that allows people to find what they need).
> 
> Now the term you hear most often is User Experience Design, or just User Experience (UXD or UX, for short), and there are probably a dozen specialties involved, like Interaction Design, Interface Design, Visual Design, and Content Management—and, of course, Usability and Information Architecture—all under the UX umbrella.
> 
> One difference between User Centered Design and User Experience Design is their scope. UCD focused on designing the right product and making sure that it was usable. UX sees its role as taking the users’ needs into account at every stage of the product life cycle, from the time they see an ad on TV, through purchasing it and tracking its delivery online, and even returning it to a local branch store.
> 
> The good news is that there’s a lot more awareness now of the importance of focusing on the user. Steve Jobs (and Jonathan Ive) made a very compelling business case for UX, and as a result usability is an easier sell than it was even a few years ago.
> 
> The bad news is that where usability used to be the standard bearer for user-friendly design, now it’s got a lot of siblings looking for seats at the table, each convinced that their set of tools are the best ones for the job. The worse news is that not many people understand the differences between the specialties or the unique contributions they can make.
> 
> This is the field you’re playing on. So when someone tells you: “I’m in UX” or “Usability is so 2002—it’s all UX now,” smile graciously and ask them a few questions about how they’re learning about users, how they’re testing whether people can use what they’re building, and how they get changes to happen. If they don’t do any of those things, they need your help. If they do, learn from them. It’s not what we call ourselves that matters, it’s the attitude we bring and the skills we can contribute.
