# Don't Make Me Think

© 2014 Steve Krug

## Chapter 1. Don't make me think!

> I could list dozens of things that users shouldn’t spend their time thinking about, like
> 
> - Where am I?
>
> - Where should I begin?
>
> - Where did they put _____?
>
> - What are the most important things on this page?
>
> - Why did they call it that?
>
> - Is that an ad or part of the site?
>
> But the last thing you need is another checklist to add to your stack of design checklists. The most important thing you can do is to understand the basic principle of eliminating question marks. When you do, you’ll begin to notice all the things that make you think in the sites and apps you use. And eventually you’ll learn to recognize and avoid them in the things you’re building.
> 
> Your goal should be for each page or screen to be self-evident, so that just by looking at it the average user2 will know what it is and how to use it. In other words, they’ll “get it” without having to think about it.

## Chapter 2. How we really use the Web

> In all the time I’ve spent watching people use the Web, the thing that has struck me most is the difference between how we think people use Web sites and how they actually use them.
> 
> When we’re creating sites, we act as though people are going to pore over each page, reading all of our carefully crafted text, figuring out how we’ve organized things, and weighing their options before deciding which link to click.
> 
> What they actually do most of the time (if we’re lucky) is _glance_ at each new page, scan _some_ of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they’re looking for. There are almost always large parts of the page that they don’t even look at.
>
> ...
> 
> **We don't read pages. We scan them.**
> 
> One of the very few well-documented facts about Web use is that people tend to spend very little time reading most Web pages. Instead, we scan (or skim) them, looking for words or phrases that catch our eye.
> 
> ...
> 
> Like Ginger, we tend to focus on words and phrases that seem to match the task at hand or our current or ongoing personal interests. And of course, (c) the trigger words that are hardwired into our nervous systems, like “Free,” “Sale,” and “Sex,” and our own name.
> 
> ...
> 
> **We don’t make optimal choices. We satisfice.**
> 
> ...
> 
> In reality, though, most of the time we _don’t_ choose the best option—we choose the _first reasonable option_, a strategy known as satisficing.1 As soon as we find a link that seems like it might lead to what we’re looking for, there’s a very good chance that we’ll click it.
> 
> ...
> 
> **We don’t figure out how things work. We muddle through**
> 
> ...
> 
> Faced with any sort of technology, very few people take the time to read instructions. Instead, we forge ahead and muddle through, making up our own vaguely plausible stories about what we’re doing and why it works.

## Chapter 3. Billboard Design 101

> Faced with the fact that your users are whizzing by, there are some important things you can do to make sure they see and understand as much of what they need to know—and of what you want them to know—as possible:
> 
> - Take advantage of conventions
> 
> - Create effective visual hierarchies
> 
> - Break pages up into clearly defined areas
> 
> - Make it obvious what’s clickable
> 
> - Eliminate distractions
> 
> - Format content to support scanning
> 
> ...
> 
> In the past twenty years, many conventions for Web pages have evolved. As users, we’ve come to have a lot of expectations about
> 
> - **Where things will be located on a page.** For example, users expect the logo identifying the site to be in the top-left corner (at least in countries where reading is left-to-right) and the primary navigation to be across the top or down the left side.
> 
> - **How things work.** For example, almost all sites that sell products use the metaphor of a shopping cart and a very similar series of forms for specifying things like your method of payment, your shipping address, and so on.
>
> - **How things look.** Many elements have a standardized appearance, like the icon that tells you it’s a link to a video, the search icon, and the social networking sharing options.
> 
> ...
> 
> The rule of thumb is that you can—and _should_—be as creative and innovative as you want, and add as much aesthetic appeal as you can, _as long as you make sure it’s still usable_.
>
> ...
> 
> **Keep the noise down to a dull roar**
> 
> One of the great enemies of easy-to-grasp pages is visual noise.
>
> Users have varying tolerances for complexity and distractions; some people have no problem with noisy pages, but many find them downright annoying. Users have even been known to put Post-its on their screen to cover up animation that’s distracting them while they’re trying to read.
>
> There are really three different kinds of noise:
>
> - **Shouting.** When everything on the page is clamoring for your attention, the effect can be overwhelming: Lots of invitations to buy! Lots of exclamation points, different typefaces, and bright colors! Automated slideshows, animation, pop-ups, and the never-ending array of new attention-grabbing ad formats!
>
> The truth is, _everything_ can’t be important. Shouting is usually the result of a failure to make tough decisions about which elements are really the most important and then create a visual hierarchy that guides users to them first.
> 
> - **Disorganization.** Some pages look like a room that’s been ransacked, with things strewn everywhere. This is a sure sign that the designer doesn’t understand the importance of using grids to align the elements on a page.
>
> - **Clutter.** We’ve all seen pages—especially Home pages—that just have too much _stuff_. The net effect is the same as when your email inbox is flooded with things like newsletters from sites that have decided that your one contact with them has made you lifelong friends: It’s hard to find and focus on the messages you actually care about. You end up with what engineers call a low signal-to-noise ratio: Lots of noise, not much information, and the noise obscures the useful stuff.
>
> When you’re editing your Web pages, it’s probably a good idea to start with the assumption that _everything_ is visual noise (the “presumed guilty until proven innocent” approach) and get rid of anything that’s not making a real contribution. In the face of limited time and attention, everything that’s not part of the solution must go.

## Chapter 4. Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral?

> I think the rule of thumb might be something like “three mindless, unambiguous clicks equal one click that requires thought.”
> 
> ...
> 
> It was the feeling I get when I’m standing in front of two mailboxes labeled Stamped Mail and Metered Mail with a business reply card in my hand. What do they think it is—stamped or metered? And what happens if I drop it in the wrong box?
> 
> ...
> 
> This problem of giving the user difficult choices and questions that are hard to answer happens all the time in forms.
> 
> ...
> 
> When you can’t avoid giving me a difficult choice, you need to go out of your way to give me as much guidance as I need—but no more.
> 
> This guidance works best when it’s
>
> - Brief: The smallest amount of information that will help me
>
> - Timely: Placed so I encounter it exactly when I need it
>
> - Unavoidable: Formatted in a way that ensures that I’ll notice it

## Chapter 5. Omit Needless Words

> Of the five or six things that I learned in college, the one that has stuck with me the longest—and benefited me the most—is E. B. White’s seventeenth rule in _The Elements of Style_:
> 
>   **17. Omit needless words.**
>   
>   Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.
>
> When I look at most Web pages, I’m struck by the fact that most of the words I see are just taking up space, because no one is ever going to read them. And just by being there, all the extra words suggest that you may actually _need_ to read them to understand what’s going on, which often makes pages seem more daunting than they actually are.
