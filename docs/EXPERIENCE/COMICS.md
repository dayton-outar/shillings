# The DC Comics Guid to Creating Comics

© 2013 DC Comics,  Carl Potts

## Chapter 1. COMICS and SEQUENTIAL VISUAL STORYTELLING

> **Narrative + Art + Sequential Visual Storytelling = Comics**

Narrative + Art + Sequential Visual Storytelling = Comics

> So what is SVS? Basically, it consists of:
> 
> - The visuals a comics creator chooses to show (and not show)
> - The framing, angle, layout, and rendering of the visual elements
> - The juxtaposition, order, and sequence of the visual elements
> - The emphasis that the visual elements are given relative to one another
> 
> ...
> 
> The terms _comic books_ and _comics_ are holdovers from the 1930s, when comics first appeared. Early comics were collections of humor-based newspaper strips. These two terms stuck even when new material that encompassed a wider range of genres and subjects took over the comic book format.

## Chapter 2. YOUR BRAIN on COMICS!

> Although the comic artist’s work is reductive, the comics reader’s experience is _additive_. Relying on the visuals in the comic, the readers have to fill in the gaps—they have to imagine what is taking place in the gutters between panels.
>
> The reader fills in what takes place in the gutters by using the information supplied in the story and, at least in part, by referring to his or her personal experiences. For example, if the artist creates a martial arts fight sequence, a reader with martial arts training may fill in the gaps with mental images that are different from those supplied by someone who has never set foot in a dojo. Similarly, a reader trained in traditional karate may fill in the gaps with visuals different from those of a reader trained in kung fu.

## Chapter 3. GOALS and PRINCIPLES of SEQUENTIAL VISUAL STORYTELLING

> _Be truly objective in judging a new [visual storytelling] method or idea. Try it. If it plays—if it is acceptable—and the audience comprehends and enjoys it—use it. If it simply confuses, teases or even distracts the audience from the narrative—discard it!_
> 
> — Joseph V. Mascelli
> 
> ...
> 
> For all three elements that combine to make comics (narrative + art + SVS) it is best to keep a balance between the conventional and the inventional. (An _inventional_ approach utilizes unconventional or unexpected panel design, layout, drawing techniques, or other visual approaches.) That means comics creators can utilize the standards and conventions of the comics medium that enable the audience to easily follow and understand the story while occasionally doing something outside the norm as long as it adds to the audience’s experience without being too distracting. ...
> 
> The overall guiding goal for the sequential visual storyteller is:
> 
> **Keep the reader immersed in the story or narrative**
> 
> The goal is that simple.
> 
> ...
> 
> All the _decisions_ that comics creators make (what to encapsulate and juxtapose from the range of visual storytelling possibilities), along with the _executions_ of the artwork (drawing, design, script, color, lettering, etc.), should support the goal of keeping the reader immersed.
> 
> ...
> 
> Inconsistent drawing levels and styles also can interrupt the readers’ immersion. ...
> 
> ![Batman story told in complex panel layout](/.attachments/comic.books.batman.complex.panels.jpg)
> 
> _The panel and content design for this example present a number of confusing eye-path issues for the reader._
> 
> Comics creators should make sure that readers:
> 
> - Are visually supplied with all the information necessary to stay immersed in the story
> - Do not have to break their suspension of disbelief to try to figure out where their eyes are supposed to go to next or what the art is portraying
> - Don’t encounter unnecessary or distracting elements
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Gotham City](/.attachments/comic.books.gotham.jpg)
> 
> _This is an establishing shot of Gotham City at night._
> 
> ![Gotham City on Fire](/.attachments/comic.books.gotham.on.fire.jpg)
> 
> _In this reestablishing shot, the same section of Gotham that was shown earlier in the story is now ablaze. Showing such a large and previously established area of the city on fire makes it immediately clear that the inferno is not confined to one or two buildings._
> 
> ...
> 
> Part of keeping a character’s actions clear involves keeping the character’s direction on the “stage” consistent. If a character is established moving from right to left within a panel frame, ideally, subsequent panels showing that character’s continuing action will maintain a right-to-left axis. Maintaining this _action flow continuity_ is an important concept that does not get as much attention in comics as it used to. This is due in part to the influence of chaotic, quick-cut, documentary-like music videos and 3D game environments that have affected film, TV, and comics.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Batman movement: left-to-right](/.attachments/comic.books.batman.ltr.panel.jpg)
> 
> _On this page, Batman’s movement in each panel consistently has a left-to-right bias, making it clear that he is not changing direction as he travels through this sequence._
> 
> ...
> 
> Good visual storytelling is usually invisible to the reader. That is, if comics creators are doing their jobs well, the reader will be immersed in the stories and will not be consciously aware of the visual storytelling techniques the comics creators use.
> 
> ...
> 
> Clearly show all the visual information so that the script does not _have_ to include descriptive information. That way, the script, if any is needed, can concentrate on nonvisual information, additional detail, and subtext.
> 
> ...
> 
> Part of showing and not telling is “setting up and paying off”: establishing visual elements in the story ahead of time if they will affect the narrative directly. If a character enters a room, the establishing shot should show where everything in that room is in relation to the character and to all the other objects in the room. Included in the establishing shot should be any visual element that will appear later in the sequence. For example, if later in the story a character retrieves a laptop computer that was sitting on his coffee table, the laptop on the table should be included in the scene’s original establishing shot. The mood of a scene or a character can be set up in advance so that it pays off later when that mood more directly affects the narrative.

> 
> ![Batman riding in Gotham: Good design ](/.attachments/comic.book.subtext.good.design.jpg)
> 
> _When all the needed information is supplied visually, the copy can concentrate on subtext and/or information that visuals can’t easily impart._

## Chapter 4. REDUCTION, ENCAPSULATION, and JUXTAPOSITION

> **Reduction**
> 
> ...
> 
> Even if the creator wanted to, showing all the story’s events in relative real time would be impractical and might result in boring storytelling. For example, in a war story, much of a soldier’s time is spent digging and waiting in foxholes, cleaning weapons, standing guard duty, eating rations, and so on. Relatively little of the scenario’s time span will include the exciting external action of combat or dramatic interpersonal conflict that is usually the focus of the story.
> 
> That said, important moments in a story often include scenes with little external action. If they support the story, panels that show landscapes, characters in silent contemplation, or other “quiet” scenes are at least as important as those featuring dramatic external action. For example, it may be important in a war story to show and contrast the extensive periods of inactivity with the bursts of terrifying action. In such cases, the comics creator needs to decide how best to show those mundane moments in a visually interesting way and how much space to devote to them relative to the rest of the story.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Sgt. Rock](/.attachments/comic.book.sgt.rock.jpg)
> 
> _When deciding what to show and not show, comics creators have to determine which parts of the overall narrative are expendable. Sometimes, even in action genres, periods of relative inactivity can give insights into characters, add mood, and provide a contrast to the scenes of overt action. Such is the case in this ***Sgt. Rock*** scene drawn by the late legendary artist, editor, and teacher Joe Kubert._
> 
> **Encapsulation**
> 
> Comics creators need to consider a number of factors when deciding what to encapsulate from a narrative. These factors include (but are not limited to):
> - Advancing the story:
>   
>   - Showing the information necessary to move the plot forward.
>
> - Establishing or reestablishing a scene, characters, or other information:
>
>   - In most cases, the first time a setting is seen in a story or issue, the artist needs to establish the scene’s characters and physical environment clearly. Also, when an established environment or character has not been seen by the reader for a while during the course of an issue, it is good to reestablish that scene or character when the focus returns to that locale or character. This reminds readers of information they may have forgotten and also shows them if there have been changes since the scene or characters were last seen.
>
>   In addition to the need to establish physical environments, creators need to establish the mood of the scene.
> 
> - Suspense/tension:
> 
>   - Does the creator wish to conceal or only partially reveal some information to build suspense?
>
> - Emphasis:
> 
>   - What information should be stressed or made blatant to the reader and what information should be revealed subtly or subconsciously or even withheld?
> 
> - Pacing:
> 
>   - At what pace does the creator wish the reader to experience the various aspects of the story?
> 
> - Marketing:
> 
>   - Covers and some splash pages are designed, at least in part, to entice the viewer to pick up and purchase a comic.
> 
> If the writer creates a full script, it is his or her job to make all the _reduction_ decisions, sorting out which moments to show in each panel. Full scripts include descriptions of the visual contents for every panel on each page, along with all dialogue, captions, and sound effects. This is part of the reason writers need to understand the principles and techniques of sequential visual storytelling.
> 
> In some cases, writers also make _encapsulation_ decisions, describing how far the “camera” will be from the subject or subjects in the panel, how the shot will be cropped, how the panel will be shaped, framed, lit, and so on. However, in many cases, when working from a full script that does not go deeply into panel descriptions, it is the artist who will make the bulk of the encapsulation decisions.
> 
> If the artist is also the writer or is working from another writer’s plot (as opposed to a full script), it will be his or her job to decide what to encapsulate and emphasize panel by panel.
> 
> Doing so involves another group of decisions:
> 
> - How close or far will the camera be from the subject(s)?
> 
> - At what angle will the subject(s) be seen?
> 
> - Which subjects will be of primary focus and which ones will be secondary?
> 
> - In what shape and size will the panel be in which the subject is encapsulated?
> 
> - How will the subject or scene be cropped and framed?
> 
> - How will the subject be lit and rendered?
> 
> - What sort of design balance works best?
> 
> If artists need to show Superman flying over Metropolis in a single panel, they have to decide how to frame that scene: the angle of the shot, how to crop it, and how much of the page’s “real estate” it will occupy.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Superman over Metropolis](/.attachments/comic.book.superman.over.metropolis.all.jpg)
> 
> _The level of importance artists place on a scene and the number of pages they have to play with both affect the way artists frame the scene._
> 
> ![Superman over Metropolis](/.attachments/comic.book.superman.over.metropolis.reduced.jpg)
> 
> _If page count and space allow, the artist (with his or her editor’s blessing) may use larger and/or more visuals to give the scene a sense of scope, elapsed time, and/or emphasis_
>
> **Juxtaposition**
> 
> The artist must combine the encapsulated visuals (panels) into a sequence on the page by juxtaposing them next to one another in a desired order.
> 
> The order in which the panels are meant to be read should be clear. If a reader’s eye path does not follow the one that the artist intended, the reader will experience a very different, and probably confusing, story.
> 
> In addition to juxtaposing the panels, comics creators juxtapose the copy elements (captions, word balloons, sound effects) with the visuals and with other elements within each panel.
> 
> The addition of words to a panel creates a juxtaposition that can result in a range of effects.
> 
> The juxtaposition of the chosen panels and other visual elements tells the story for the readers, along with the visual information the readers conjure in their heads when filling in the gaps between the juxtaposed panels.
> 
> ![Superman soars](/.attachments/comic.book.superman.soars.jpg)
> 
> _Sometimes the words are ***redundant*** and simply reinforce what the visual shows. Generally, this is not considered good form and usually is reserved for titles aimed at a young audience or for scenes in which a point has to be made absolutely clear._
> 
> ![Superman moves to the call](/.attachments/comic.book.superman.irresistible.call.jpg)
> 
> _Complementary juxtaposition between art and words creates a fuller “picture” of the scenario for the reader, going beyond what either the visual or the words could produce alone._

## Chapter 5. ALL ABOUT PANELS

> A comics panel is visual content that encapsulates a moment from a larger narrative. Panels usually juxtapose visual content with words.

## Chapter 6. The BIG PICTURE

> Creating pages containing a series of juxtaposed panels requires a strong sense of design to keep the audience immersed in the narrative.
> 
> Each page of a story usually contains multiple panels arranged in a way that:
> 
> - Propels the story forward in a clear and compelling way
> 
> - Keeps the reader’s eyes moving in the correct path
> 
> - Is a semi-self-contained unit of design
> 
> - Is also part of a larger sequence
> 
> ***The key is to make the reader’s eye path clear while telling the tale in a way that compels the reader forward.***
> 
> ...
> 
> The biggest marketing tool a comics creator or publisher has is the cover. A cover should entice potential buyers to grab that comic and take it to the checkout, whether in physical shops or online.
> 
> Usually, the cover has to grab the potential buyer’s attention while competing with numerous other covers surrounding it on physical or virtual racks.
> 
> Cover content usually falls into several categories.
> 
> ![Batman Detective Comics Cover](/.attachments/comic.books.cover.scene.jpg)
> 
> _A dynamic or dramatic ***scene*** from the story contained in the comic._
> 
> ![Teen Titans Comics Cover](/.attachments/comic.books.cover.symbolic.jpg)
> 
> _A ***symbolic*** cover that presents the characters and/or a situation that may or may not relate directly to the story inside that issue. Pinup-type shots of characters in dramatic poses or engaged in a dynamic physical action fall into this category._
> 
> ![The Judas Coin Comics Cover](/.attachments/comic.books.cover.montage.jpg)
> 
> _A ***montage*** of elements from the interior story._

## Chapter 7. WHERE are WE?

> Characters, vehicles, and other subjects often are shown moving through environments in sequences composed of numerous panels. Making sure the direction in which a subject is moving remains clear can be tricky when a wide variety of shots and angles are employed over a sequence of panels. There are techniques comics creators can use to keep those subjects and the reader properly oriented.
> 
> **Map Orientation**
> 
> Sequential visual storytelling media use rectangular formats, usually in the form of horizontal rectangles.
> 
> The audience has grown up looking at rectangular maps where north is at the top, south on the bottom, east to the right, and west to the left. Viewers of visual storytelling media have this map orientation stored in their subconscious, and creators of visual narratives can use it to their advantage.
> 
> If it’s important to the story that the character, the vehicle, or any subject is traveling in a specific compass direction, comics creators can position that object in the frame to reflect that direction. This will resonate with the map orientation in the audience’s heads.
> 
> For example, cinematographers and directors of old Western films usually showed wagon trains moving west with a right-to-left bias within the frame, echoing the western direction of a map.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Wagon heading west of USA](/.attachments/comic.books.heading.west.jpg)
> 
> _Wagon trains departed from Missouri and headed west toward California and Oregon. That is why, in many Western films, the wagons are shot heading to the left, or west._
> 
> ...
> 
> When the action moves directly toward or away from the viewer, it is called a _neutral_ shot. Neutral shots can be used in any sequence, no matter which direction has been established for the scene’s action bias. However, when using a neutral shot, it is best to establish the action flow bias before the neutral shot or shots and then reestablish the action’s bias after a neutral shot or shots.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Showing Neutral Shot of Horses on Wagon](/.attachments/comic.books.neutral.shot.jpg)
> 
> _Directionally neutral shots show action moving directly toward or directly away from the camera. Note that in this panel, even though the horses are moving directly away from the viewer, the dirt trail they follow bends from right to left, maintaining the sequence’s action flow bias._
> 
> **Action Flow Continuity**
> 
> Action flow continuity involves establishing and maintaining the movement direction of characters, vehicles, and other objects in the story environment.
> 
> Even when the viewer doesn’t consciously register contradictory action flow, it can be unsettling on an unconscious level.
> 
> If, in a story, a character madly dashes around, looking all over for something in a chaotic fashion, showing the character changing direction from panel to panel in the frantic search sequence is actually good storytelling. Otherwise, it is best to establish and maintain each character’s action flow continuity.
> 
> In film and TV, this concept is referred to as the 180-degree rule.
> 
> When filming on a stage or a set, filmmakers usually establish a line, an _action axis_ that runs through the scene. To keep the action flow continuity consistent, they keep the camera on one side of the action axis. They do not cross the line.
> 
> It can help to think of the scene as being on a theater stage. The action axis runs along the rear wall of the stage, and so moving the camera beyond that line is impossible.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Camera Views of Scene](/.attachments/comic.books.camera.views.jpg)
> 
> _The gray area on the floor shows the semicircle that gives the 180 degree rule its name. The flat side of the gray area is the action axis. As can be seen by the positions of cameras 1, 2, and 3, filmmakers generally do not move the camera over the action axis. If a camera moves beyond the action axis (camera 4 view), it makes the characters or objects in the environment switch the side of the screen they are facing. Camera 4’s view makes it appear as though Batman is running away from his foe._
> 
> ...
> 
> If in the course of a story a character or vehicle changes direction in its environment, it is best to show that change clearly. Ideally, comics artists should show the turn relative to the previous direction and establish the new direction.
> 
> ![Batman drives and changes direction](/.attachments/comic.books.batman.changes.direction.jpg)
> 
> _When a subject changes direction in a story, the artist should show the turn (third panel) and establish the subject’s new directional bias._
> 
> There are times when the camera has to travel across the action axis. In those cases, there are ways to minimize any disconcerting effects on the readers.
> 
> Often, these reverse angles are done during sequences with multiple characters conversing while sitting and facing the same direction. They may be seated next to each other in a restaurant booth, in a car, on a train, in a plane, or on a sofa.
> 
> After establishing the action direction, focus on a character who is facing the established direction. Then reverse the angle (hop to the other side of the action axis) to focus on another character when he or she is speaking or is otherwise the focus of the shot. End the sequence by reestablishing the original action flow direction. Including reverse angles in sequences that are “bookended” by shots of the established action flow direction helps keep the audience directionally oriented.
> 
> ![Batman drives: Reverse angle on conversation](/.attachments/comic.books.batman.reverse.angle.jpg)
> 
> _When it is done carefully, action flow continuity can be maintained while incorporating reverse angles._
> 
> ![Batman drives: Reverse angle on conversation version 2](/.attachments/comic.books.batman.reverse.angle-2.jpg)
> 
> _If possible, when using reverse angles, keep the characters on the same sides of the panel as was established originally. In both of these panels, even though they are on opposite sides of the action axis, Robin remains on the left of the panel and Batman stays on the right._

## Chapter 8. MORE WAYS to ENTHRALL READERS

> If they are used in an artful way, design metaphors or visual themes can add an extra layer of creativity to visual storytelling.
> 
> This may involve using a visual element or elements that repeat throughout the work to foreshadow or reinforce a specific mood or event. Creators can use weather, lighting, color, setting, panel border design, lettering, and other visual elements to do this.
> 
> Water, especially falling water as seen in dreary rainy weather and tears, is a common metaphor for sadness in film, TV, and comics.
> 
> Sometimes it’s interesting to go against the usual or clichéd expectations of the audience. If rain and tears are typically associated with depressing situations, try turning that expectation on its head. Visual storytellers also can use falling water as a symbol of rebirth and joy, as when spring showers help grow a lush green landscape or when tears flow as a mother and child are reunited.
> 
> It’s usually better to be restrained when using design metaphors than to go over the top, hitting the readers over the head with your cleverness and drawing attention from the story instead of enhancing it.

## Chapter 9. NARRATIVE: WRITING for VISUAL STORYTELLING

> No matter what form of media is used to tell it, a story usually has a classic arc structure. The vast majority of stories you’ve read or seen incorporate a classic story arc.
> 
> Comics can employ other types of narrative too, including mood pieces, character sketches, abstract tales, and instructional and educational pieces. However, most stories generally follow an arc in which:
> 
> - One or more protagonists encounter a catalytic incident that disturbs their status quo.
> 
> - That incident propels the protagonist or protagonists actively into an escalating series of events or conflicts with one or more antagonists and/or other obstacles, whether physical or emotional.
> 
> - The events reach a climax in which the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist is resolved (at least temporarily) and the ramifications of the resolution are shown (the new status quo).
> 
> There are many celebrated works of fiction that do not follow the classic story arc. However, the majority of tales that have stood the test of time as well as the most popular contemporary works of fiction generally follow this basic arc.
> 
> ...
> 
> If you want to produce a story with the highest chance of reaching and affecting the largest possible audience, you should use a classic story arc.
> 
> ...
> 
> Writers need to _give readers what they expect, but not in the way they expect it_. Characters (including their abilities, weaknesses, and knowledge), story situations, objects of power, and environments all should be set up as the story progresses. At the climax, some of the elements that have been set up should be used in a surprising way that is still logical in the context of the story. The knowledge, ability, and/or weapons that the protagonist picked up along the course of the journey can be used in an unexpected combination at the climax.
> 
> **THE PROTAGONIST**
> 
> A _protagonist_ is the main character in and focus of the story. Most protagonists have heroic characteristics that are revealed, put to the test, and/or changed during the course of the story. There are some stories in which the protagonist is an antihero. In those cases, the protagonist is often pitted against heroic antagonists or against other nonheroic characters.
> 
> Usually, the protagonist is changed in some way by his or her story experience. At the very least, the events of the story should reinforce the character’s original point of view.
> 
> If the protagonist emerges victorious, the story has a _happy ending_. If the protagonist loses, the tale has a sad ending. If the ending is a mixture of positive and negative outcomes for the protagonist, the story has an _ironic ending_.
> 
> In the various action/adventure genres (Western, superhero, detective, sword and sorcery, etc.), there is almost always a final showdown between the main protagonist and the primary antagonist. The audience expects it and would be disappointed if the story did not contain a satisfying showdown. The trick is to add inventional elements to the expected showdown to make it novel and unexpected.

A bad example is when Jon Snow failed to go up against the _Night King_ in Game of Thrones.

> Most characters should have both conscious and subconscious desires that motivate them. Often, those desires are in conflict. For example, a character who consciously wishes that his or her actions were appreciated by others may subconsciously feel that he or she is not worthy of the admiration of others. This **inner conflict** can spark or intensify the character’s conflicts with others.
> 
> Let’s look at Batman for an example. Judging from the bulk of the character’s publishing history, it’s clear that he is usually more comfortable as Batman than he is as Bruce Wayne. If you explore the reasons for this disconnect between the Batman and Bruce Wayne personas, odds are that you’ll discover one or more conflicts between the character’s internal and external desires.
> 
> Batman’s conscious mission, his obsession, is to end crime and protect innocent lives, especially young lives. Witnessing the death of his parents as a child gave birth to this obsession.
> 
> The character has few close relationships. Even Alfred, the person closest to him, usually is kept at arm’s length. In part, this is because Batman’s obsessive fight against Gotham City’s criminal element does not allow him enough time or mental bandwidth for close relationships. Such relationships would distract him from his mission. Also, the loss of his parents was so emotionally traumatic that Batman does not want to be in a position to feel that loss again, and so he keeps most others at a distance.
> 
> Having maintained this social distancing for many years, the character has limited social skills. Outside the external formalities of public events and appearances, Bruce Wayne usually feels awkward in private personal encounters. He is comfortable only as Batman.
> 
> One might sum up Batman’s conflicting desires in these terms:
> 
> - His external (conscious) desire is to eradicate crime (particularly in Gotham).
> 
> - His inner (unconscious) desire is never to stop fighting crime.
> 
> Batman’s desires are in conflict. If Batman actually eliminated crime, he would have to stop being Batman, stop playing the difficult but largely rewarding self-made role at which he excels. Instead, he’d be left as the civilian who was handed a fortune along with an inability to deal with others.
> 
> In a way, the conflict is illogical since there is no way Batman, however hardworking and efficient he was, could totally eradicate crime. However, it may explain why Batman spends more time and resources literally fighting criminals than trying to address the conditions that help foster criminal activity.
> 
> The conflict between these two desires takes shape when Batman occasionally tries to strike up a relationship with a woman. When he does get involved with women (Catwoman, Talia al Ghūl), the women are usually at least as damaged emotionally as Batman/Wayne is. These relationships are therefore doomed. Also, his external desire leaves him no time to learn how to have a “normal” healthy relationship.
> 
> ...
> 
> Every comic book series and each story in a series should have a unifying **theme**. A theme should be something more specific than nebulous musings about “being human” or exploring “what freedom is” or similar meanderings. A thematic statement is best. It should be one or two sentences at most, and it should be a real statement. If a story works on multiple levels, there can be more than one valid thematic statement. Only one thematic statement is needed, however, to make sure all the plot elements tie into it and unify the tale. Ideally, the theme will contain a “primal” element, something about survival, freedom, love, or another basic human need or desire.
> 
> Keeping in mind what was discussed earlier in this chapter about Batman’s internal and external desires, the theme for a Batman series might be: “Obsession for a never-ending mission will, out of necessity, cause the obsessed to ‘shortchange’ other people in their lives (not be readily available) and deny themselves the experiences, pleasurable and otherwise, that most people experience during their lives.”
> 
> Batman was handed a fortune but no family. Alfred is a surrogate father but also an employee. Batman has no role models for traditional family structure or middle-class/lower-class financial values. In other words, he is disconnected from the experiences shared by most others.
> 
> What would Batman do if there were no crime? Being obsessed allows Batman to avoid some of the areas of civilian life with which he is not comfortable.
> 
> In many ways, as Batman, he is a more balanced personality than he is as Bruce Wayne. As Batman, he is an intellectual detective drawing on a broad range of knowledge while also being an elite athlete who incorporates cutting-edge technology into his work.
> 
> ...
> 
> When working on a plot for a story, see if you can come up with one or more thematic statements that all the story elements support. This will help assure that the work will feel consistent and whole to the reader.
> 
> A **self-contained story** is just that: a single tale meant to stand on its own. A reader should be able to read that particular story and experience a full and satisfying story arc.
> 
> Each issue in an ongoing or miniseries comic book title should have a serial story structure.
> 
> ...
> 
> Comics creators should be careful not to assume that their readers have years of series continuity in their heads. Even if a comics series ultimately will be collected into a trade paperback, each issue of the initial series should be structured to provide a satisfying experience for readers, both new and returning.
> 
> ...
> 
> If a new reader tries to sample an issue of an ongoing title that is not structured to be a satisfying and informative experience on its own, there is a good chance that that reader will feel alienated and not continue with the series.
> 
> Some writers like to come up with a basic premise for a story and then begin writing, assuming that the story will write itself and that a solid ending will evolve along the way. Very few writers are able to pull this off consistently. Many writers who think they can do it are fooling themselves. Their stories often meander and/or the endings are unsatisfying for the audience.
> 
> For many writers, before they write a first draft, it is important that the initial story concept include a definite ending. ... Changing the ending of the story is okay if it makes sense, but in most cases writers need to have an initial destination in mind when they begin their journey in order to reach the destination and make sure it stays in context with the rest of the story.
> 
> ...
> 
> Different writers have varying preferences for the way they approach writing. Each writer needs to do what works best for him or her. That said, be careful that what works best for you does not become an excuse to take the easy way out or to follow the same comfortable route you’ve traveled many times before. Do the preliminary work (work out a basic plot or pitch, gather and absorb the research, etc.) before you hammer away at the first draft.

> After you have your story pitch, write the first draft from the gut without obsessing about whether it conforms to a classic story arc structure. Odds are, if you are familiar with classic structure (instinctually or intellectually), you will be using a lot of that knowledge subconsciously as you write anyway.
> 
> What you don’t want to do at this stage in the writing process is get robotic about hitting each plot point in a classic arc. Doing this may result in a dry, mechanical script and inhibit some of your inventional impulses. It also may prevent you from coming up with something valuable because the idea didn’t initially fit into a strict structure model.
> 
> Here’s a step-by-step approach that works well for some writers:
> 
> - Before beginning work on the script, draft a rough story outline that includes a specific conclusion.
>
> - Do any needed research and make notes.
> 
> - Write the first draft of the script from your gut. If the story veers somewhat from the outline, explore the new direction. You can always go back later and try a draft in which you stick to the original outline.
>
> - When you finish the first draft, match the major plot elements in the script with one or more of the classic story structure models and see where your story departs from the model.*
> 
> - Wherever your story departs from the classic arc model, ask yourself as honestly as possible if the story would be better if it was altered to be more in line with the classic model—or if your initial approach is the best way to tell the story in the most compelling and creatively satisfying manner. Usually, the former will be the case. However, once in a while, it is not. You may come up with an inventional story structure variation that tells your particular story in a more compelling way than the more traditional story structure could. A major consideration here is whether you are writing solely for your own satisfaction and expression or writing to grab the attention of a larger audience.

> **CLASSIC STORY ARC SIMPLIFIED**
> 
> Based on author, lecturer, and Hollywood story consultant Christopher Vogler’s work, here is a simplified version of a classic arc:
>
> - The story begins in the protagonist’s **ordinary world**.
>
> - The protagonist receives a **call to adventure**.
>
> - Often, the protagonist initially **refuses the call**.
>
> - Sometimes the protagonist **meets a mentor** who helps convince the protagonist to do the right thing.
>
> - The protagonist **crosses a threshold** of some sort and enters a special world.
>
> - In the special world, the protagonist **encounters tests, allies, and enemies**.
>
> - The protagonist (and allies) **approach the major challenge** in the special world.
>
> - An **ordeal** is experienced by the protagonist where he/she faces death on some level.
>
> - After successfully dealing with the ordeal, the protagonist takes possession of a **reward** of some sort (saved a life, gained key information, destroyed enemy’s resources, etc.). However, the danger of losing the reward still exists.
>
> - In **the road back** to bring the reward to the ordinary world, the protagonist is often chased and in great danger.
>
> - When about to cross the threshold to return home, the protagonist is once again severely tested. He/she has a closer brush with death and is changed or experiences a **resurrection** on some level.
>
> - Having been transformed by the experience, the protagonist **returns home with the elixir** or the reward.
