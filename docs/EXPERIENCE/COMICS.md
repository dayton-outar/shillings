# The DC Comics Guid to Creating Comics

© 2013 DC Comics,  Carl Potts

## Chapter 1. COMICS and SEQUENTIAL VISUAL STORYTELLING

> **Narrative + Art + Sequential Visual Storytelling = Comics**

Narrative + Art + Sequential Visual Storytelling = Comics

> So what is SVS? Basically, it consists of:
> 
> - The visuals a comics creator chooses to show (and not show)
> - The framing, angle, layout, and rendering of the visual elements
> - The juxtaposition, order, and sequence of the visual elements
> - The emphasis that the visual elements are given relative to one another
> 
> ...
> 
> The terms _comic books_ and _comics_ are holdovers from the 1930s, when comics first appeared. Early comics were collections of humor-based newspaper strips. These two terms stuck even when new material that encompassed a wider range of genres and subjects took over the comic book format.

## Chapter 2. YOUR BRAIN on COMICS!

> Although the comic artist’s work is reductive, the comics reader’s experience is _additive_. Relying on the visuals in the comic, the readers have to fill in the gaps—they have to imagine what is taking place in the gutters between panels.
>
> The reader fills in what takes place in the gutters by using the information supplied in the story and, at least in part, by referring to his or her personal experiences. For example, if the artist creates a martial arts fight sequence, a reader with martial arts training may fill in the gaps with mental images that are different from those supplied by someone who has never set foot in a dojo. Similarly, a reader trained in traditional karate may fill in the gaps with visuals different from those of a reader trained in kung fu.

## Chapter 3. GOALS and PRINCIPLES of SEQUENTIAL VISUAL STORYTELLING

> _Be truly objective in judging a new [visual storytelling] method or idea. Try it. If it plays—if it is acceptable—and the audience comprehends and enjoys it—use it. If it simply confuses, teases or even distracts the audience from the narrative—discard it!_
> 
> — Joseph V. Mascelli
> 
> ...
> 
> For all three elements that combine to make comics (narrative + art + SVS) it is best to keep a balance between the conventional and the inventional. (An _inventional_ approach utilizes unconventional or unexpected panel design, layout, drawing techniques, or other visual approaches.) That means comics creators can utilize the standards and conventions of the comics medium that enable the audience to easily follow and understand the story while occasionally doing something outside the norm as long as it adds to the audience’s experience without being too distracting. ...
> 
> The overall guiding goal for the sequential visual storyteller is:
> 
> **Keep the reader immersed in the story or narrative**
> 
> The goal is that simple.
> 
> ...
> 
> All the _decisions_ that comics creators make (what to encapsulate and juxtapose from the range of visual storytelling possibilities), along with the _executions_ of the artwork (drawing, design, script, color, lettering, etc.), should support the goal of keeping the reader immersed.
> 
> ...
> 
> Inconsistent drawing levels and styles also can interrupt the readers’ immersion. ...

> _The panel and content design for this example present a number of confusing eye-path issues for the reader._
> 
> Comics creators should make sure that readers:
> 
> - Are visually supplied with all the information necessary to stay immersed in the story
> - Do not have to break their suspension of disbelief to try to figure out where their eyes are supposed to go to next or what the art is portraying
> - Don’t encounter unnecessary or distracting elements

> 
> _In this reestablishing shot, the same section of Gotham that was shown earlier in the story is now ablaze. Showing such a large and previously established area of the city on fire makes it immediately clear that the inferno is not confined to one or two buildings._
> 
> ...
> 
> Part of keeping a character’s actions clear involves keeping the character’s direction on the “stage” consistent. If a character is established moving from right to left within a panel frame, ideally, subsequent panels showing that character’s continuing action will maintain a right-to-left axis. Maintaining this _action flow continuity_ is an important concept that does not get as much attention in comics as it used to. This is due in part to the influence of chaotic, quick-cut, documentary-like music videos and 3D game environments that have affected film, TV, and comics.

> 
> _On this page, Batman’s movement in each panel consistently has a left-to-right bias, making it clear that he is not changing direction as he travels through this sequence._
> 
> ...
> 
> Good visual storytelling is usually invisible to the reader. That is, if comics creators are doing their jobs well, the reader will be immersed in the stories and will not be consciously aware of the visual storytelling techniques the comics creators use.
> 
> ...
> 
> Clearly show all the visual information so that the script does not _have_ to include descriptive information. That way, the script, if any is needed, can concentrate on nonvisual information, additional detail, and subtext.
> 
> ...
> 
> Part of showing and not telling is “setting up and paying off”: establishing visual elements in the story ahead of time if they will affect the narrative directly. If a character enters a room, the establishing shot should show where everything in that room is in relation to the character and to all the other objects in the room. Included in the establishing shot should be any visual element that will appear later in the sequence. For example, if later in the story a character retrieves a laptop computer that was sitting on his coffee table, the laptop on the table should be included in the scene’s original establishing shot. The mood of a scene or a character can be set up in advance so that it pays off later when that mood more directly affects the narrative.

> _When all the needed information is supplied visually, the copy can concentrate on subtext and/or information that visuals can’t easily impart._

## Chapter 4. REDUCTION, ENCAPSULATION, and JUXTAPOSITION

> **Reduction**
> 
> ...
> 
> Even if the creator wanted to, showing all the story’s events in relative real time would be impractical and might result in boring storytelling. For example, in a war story, much of a soldier’s time is spent digging and waiting in foxholes, cleaning weapons, standing guard duty, eating rations, and so on. Relatively little of the scenario’s time span will include the exciting external action of combat or dramatic interpersonal conflict that is usually the focus of the story.
> 
> That said, important moments in a story often include scenes with little external action. If they support the story, panels that show landscapes, characters in silent contemplation, or other “quiet” scenes are at least as important as those featuring dramatic external action. For example, it may be important in a war story to show and contrast the extensive periods of inactivity with the bursts of terrifying action. In such cases, the comics creator needs to decide how best to show those mundane moments in a visually interesting way and how much space to devote to them relative to the rest of the story.

> 
> _When deciding what to show and not show, comics creators have to determine which parts of the overall narrative are expendable. Sometimes, even in action genres, periods of relative inactivity can give insights into characters, add mood, and provide a contrast to the scenes of overt action. Such is the case in this ***Sgt. Rock*** scene drawn by the late legendary artist, editor, and teacher Joe Kubert._
