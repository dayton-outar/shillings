_Practival Insights in Brain Science to Help Students Learn_

## Chapter 1. Building Memory

> _Long-term memory_ is what it sounds like—it holds the information we’re able to store and bring back to mind from weeks, months, or even years before. As we’ve seen, you can think of long-term memory as sets of neural links that students have developed when they’ve learned the material well. As we also mentioned previously, these neural links congregate in the neocortex—the thin sheet of neural tissue that rides over the ridges and deep grooves of the brain’s surface. If we reinforce the links of long-term learning through varied practice, our learning is generally in good shape. (By varied practice, we mean not just practicing with the same material. For example, you don’t want to just sit around testing yourself on lists of new foreign language vocabulary words. You also want to use those new words in a variety of different sentences and contexts.)
> 
> But _working memory_—that temporary holding pattern for thoughts—is different from long-term memory. Rather than sets of links that reside happily in the neocortex, working memory is more like an octopus tossing a set of balls. These balls represent thoughts that bounce over and over again from the front to the back of your brain, as long as you are holding the ideas in working memory. An average working memory can hold up to four “balls” before ideas begin slipping from the mind, as you can see in the “quadropus” on this page. (Incidentally, students can’t grow more arms on their octopuses. But the more students practice with the material, the bigger the balls of information can become. More on this soon.)
> 
> ...
> 
> But getting the information into long-term memory can be difficult. We’ll be exploring this vital topic in more detail in chapter 3. The key idea, however, is that retrieval practice is one of the best techniques for strengthening new information in long-term memory. Retrieval practice means drawing ideas you’re starting to learn from your own mind rather than simply looking at the answer. Good examples of retrieval practice include using flash cards or merely looking away from a page to see if you can retrieve the key idea or ideas on the page.

## Chapter 2. Teacher Inclusively

> Nobel Prize–winning economist Friedrich Hayek, for example, observed that unlike his swift-learning colleagues, his innovative breakthroughs came from his slow, muddling struggle to grasp the material. Being forced to find his own way of expressing accepted ideas allowed him to see gaps and unjustified assumptions that others missed.
> 
> ...
> 
> You can think of students’ differing working memory capacities as being like our familiar octopus but with differing numbers of arms. The average working memory of an older teenager or adult is four arms—meaning they can simultaneously hold a maximum of four pieces of information. But this is just an average. Some students have larger-capacity working memories—they can hold six or more pieces of information at once. Others have less working memory capacity—they can hold perhaps three items at once. All these students can learn well—they just need different approaches to enable them to be successful.

> 
> _Students can vary substantially in their working memory capacity. Although the average is four “arms” on their attentional octopuses (that is, four pieces of information they can hold in mind), some students may have only three arms, while still others can have six or more arms._

> 
> ![Scaffolding Instructions](/.attachments/scaffolding.instructions.jpg)
> 
> _Scaffolded instruction allows students to gradually climb to heights that might at first seem insurmountable._
> 
> Here’s what scaffolding can look like for hiker-type learners:
> 
> - **Meeting with individual students or in small groups to reteach a concept or skill**. Students may feel safer asking you what they perceive to be “stupid questions” individually or within the small group. Your one-on-one or one-on-a-few discussion will allow them the opportunity to talk through their understanding of the concept or the task they are supposed to complete.
> 
> - **Allowing more time** for a student to complete a task or practice solidifying the skill.
> 
> - **Breaking down the steps** of a problem by providing examples for each step along the way toward completion.
> 
> - **Using criteria that match and then extend individual students’ skill levels**. For example, being prepared with a variety of questions at different levels of difficulty.
> 
> At the same time, how can you best scaffold instruction for race-car learners?
> 
> - **Go beyond simple factual questions** with answers that are “right there” by asking more in-depth questions and exploring how concepts connect.
> 
> - **Allow race-car learners the opportunity to work with one another**—to bounce ideas off of and challenge one another with multiple perspectives.
> 
> - **Don’t just give race-car learners more of the same types of problems to do**. They may take it as a punishment. Instead, create more complex, multilayered problems and assignments—or ask them to devise their own problems.
> 
> - **Allow students to choose among meaningful “sponge activities” to soak up extra class time**. These sponge activities could be reading authentic* texts on the current topic. Or such an activity could be an extension project the student develops and the teacher monitors.
> 
> - **Accelerate learning** by allowing race cars to use video-game-like computer software that individualizes instruction based on their responses.
> 
> ...
> 
> The challenge, of course, is that a typical classroom contains students with a hodgepodge of working memory capacities. The typical mixed teaching techniques used by many teachers—a combination of teacher-directed and more student-directed approaches—can be effective for large-capacity students. But students with lesser capacities often need more practice and teacher direction to bring them on board so that student-directed approaches can subsequently take hold.
> 
> ...
> 
> **And this is why instruction that includes multiple opportunities for practice to break up the lesson can be so valuable**. These active periods allow students to begin the sometimes arduous transfer of ideas from working memory into long-term memory, assisted by the helpful reinforcement of the hippocampus. Such active periods also allow students time to consolidate the information.

## Chapter 3. Active Learning. The Declarative Pathway

> So what is active learning? Zoologist turned active learning expert Scott Freeman and his colleagues—authors of the meta-analysis cited above—surveyed university instructors to provide the following working definition: “Active learning engages students in the process of learning through activities and/or discussion in class, as opposed to passively listening to an expert. It emphasizes higher-order thinking and often involves group work.”
> 
> ...
> 
> It’s not so much that particular bits of information are vital in and of themselves—although some certainly are. It’s more that people need to have enough facts in their heads to have what one commentator has called “a knowledge party”—a bunch of accumulated associations that will enable them to absorb, retain, and analyze new information.
> 
> ...
> 
> How long should your brain break be? Our brains take an eight-hour break at night when we fall asleep, when memories are consolidated on a global scale. But much of the preparation is done during briefer breaks throughout the day. One study revealed that a fifteen-minute period of eyes-closed rest following learning enhanced the memory of what was just learned far more than when the participants simply went on to another task. But fifteen minutes of eyes-closed rest is not going to fly in today’s classrooms!
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Thus, far from being a waste of time, “rest” during wakefulness may end up being a crucial and widely underappreciated contributor to long-term memory formation in everyday life.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Unfortunately, it can be easy to fall into the trap of wanting to use the group activity to quickly check your email or get ready for the next part of the lesson. But this is how off-task student behaviors creep in and cause students to lose their focus. After all, if you aren’t keeping your focus on your students, it sends an inadvertent signal that it’s all right for your students to go off task, too. Worse yet, without your dedicated attention, students may move on to the next lesson with misinformation.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... But the seemingly successful cramming process creates two problems. First, if the new learning in the neocortex isn’t reinforced by the hippocampus over subsequent days, the neocortical information and the hippocampal indexing links both simply fade away, whether the learner is a race car or a hiker.
> 
> The second problem is perhaps even worse. It turns out that sleep, with its different-from-waking bath of neural chemicals and altered activity levels, serves as a sort of sealant for newly formed links in long-term memory. A night of cramming, with little or no sleep at the end, means that whatever information might have slipped into long-term memory in the neocortex doesn’t stick.
> 
> ...
> 
> But great, only if what students are retaining is meaningful information. As education journalist Natalie Wexler points out, “Standard elementary literacy curricula focus on largely illusory comprehension skills—like finding the main idea—rather than content. Getting fourth graders to memorize the definition of, for example, ‘inferences’ won’t be enough to enable them to make or explain inferences.”
> 
> Assuming content is meaningful and not a Grecian urn, retrieval practice is what our poorly performing students Katina and Jared were missing when they were studying. They weren’t working actively with the material, pulling it from their minds. Instead, they were just copying whatever was in front of them or looking at the solutions and thinking that was enough to put the material in long-term memory.

## Chapter 4. Remedies for Procrastination

> ...
> 
> ... Psychologists have pointed to myriad reasons. Perhaps the most fundamental is that when Sam and your other procrastination-prone students (and even you!) think about something they don’t like or don’t want to do, it activates feelings of pain in the insular cortex—a part of the brain that processes pain signals. How does someone like Sam deal with these uncomfortable feelings? Simple. He just thinks about something—anything—else. Avoidance works like a charm in taking away the pain of the moment. But the problem is, he’s just procrastinating. There’ll be long-term pain to pay—like stressing out at midnight and then falling asleep during the test.
> 
> ...
> 
> Great teachers help students work through the more challenging aspects of what they are learning by providing intermediate incentives, making the rewards seem more immediate and the day-by-day outcomes worthwhile. Ultimately, students can catch sight of the promised land—a sense of what it’s like to have mastered the material. The inspiration and motivation excellent teaching can unleash is not, at least as yet, something we can put into a bottle.
> 
> ...
> 
> I procrastinate. You procrastinate. We _all_ procrastinate—especially our students. Here are some reasons offered by seventh-grade language arts students who answered two questions—_Why do you procrastinate?_ and _What are the consequences?_—along with our suggestions for combating procrastination.
> 
> - I procrastinate when I am in class and I don’t know how to do the work. I fail and get picked on.
> 
> - I like to do the easy work first and procrastinate on the hard stuff. If it’s too hard, I just tell my teacher that I tried.
> 
> Knowing how to get started can be a stumbling block for some students. Working one-on-one or in small groups at the very beginning can get those students on the right track. Staying on a challenging task is another common struggle for many students. Return to those students as the work gets more challenging to check on their progress. Then assist as needed.
> 
> ...
> 
> The best way for a brain to find and make those dramatic new connections is for it to go from focused into diffuse mode.
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Focused Mode vs. Diffuse Mode](/.attachments/focused.vs.diffused.more.jpg)
> 
> _Switching between focused mode (where working memory is focusing as it reaches toward the sets of links in long-term memory) and diffuse mode (where random connections can form) helps students to grapple mentally with tough new ideas._
> 
> In focused mode, working memory is making connections among the neurons of the hippocampus and neocortex. You can see this process on the left in the illustration above. Diffuse mode, on the other hand, is when the brain takes a bit of a break from external focusing, as shown on the right in the image. In diffuse mode, working memory gets out of the picture and the brain subconsciously starts to make random connections. Diffuse thinking is what you’re doing when you’re daydreaming or thinking randomly as you walk down the hall, take a shower, or fall asleep. You are much more conscious of focused than of diffuse mode thinking.
> 
> ...
> 
> But when a student starts to fall into frustration, that’s precisely when she should back away and take her mind _off_ the concept. It’s only when she gets her focus _off_ the concept that she can go into diffuse mode. Diffuse thinking allows a student’s brain to work behind the scenes, randomly exploring new connections while she’s taking a break, or eating lunch, or clowning around during recess. Later, when she returns to her previous point of frustration, it can seem like magic. What made no sense at all before can suddenly seem easy!
> 
> ...
> 
> Knowing when frustration has just reached a peak, so it’s time to switch to something else or take a break, is a valuable learning meta-skill. It comes in particularly handy on tests, where students often can’t unstick themselves once they become stuck on a problem.
> 
> ...
> 
> Students often don’t have the time management skills to break a large task down and chip away at it—especially when they are constantly feeling the pull of video games, sports, texting, and other social activities. By creating specific shorter assignments that serve as the building blocks for the whole project, you model effective strategies to guard against procrastination.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Three Parts of a Rubric—Along with Guidelines That Get Results**
> 
> 1. **Criteria you’ll be assessing**. Measure what matters most. This means focusing on your learning outcomes—the essential knowledge and skills of the assignment. It is all too easy to include fringe criteria that don’t align with the purpose of the assignment. (While aesthetics and time on task are nice, should a student really be losing points for using 11-point font rather than 12-point?) In a typical writing assignment, the criteria may involve, for example, focus; content; organization; conclusion; and CUPS (capitalization, usage, punctuation, and spelling). You may know in your mind’s eye what focus looks like, but your students can’t read your mind and most likely won’t share that vision. Be explicit. This leads us to the next part of the rubric.
> 
> 2. **Explicit description of the expectation for each criterion**. For example, by focus, you may mean including a thesis statement in the introduction and substantiating it with multiple arguments throughout the essay. Content likely includes the logic of the arguments, the accuracy of the information, and a minimum number of references. Your students need these clarifications. That way, they can easily go back to what they have written and self-assess before submitting a finalized product. The more specific your expectations, the better your students’ results.
> 
> 3. **Point value or rating scale**. Before arbitrarily assigning 10 points for each category, think about the cognitive demands of each. Developing support for an argument by synthesizing multiple resources is much more challenging than catching grammatical errors. (Although grammatical conventions are important, too.) Instead of assigning a point value directly to each criterion, consider a slightly less direct approach that uses a rating scale with different levels for each criterion. Thus points could be assigned for exceeding expectations (4 points), meeting (3 points), approaching (2 points), or beginning (1 point) expectations. When using a rating scale, clarify the expectations for each rating.

## Chapter 5. How Human Brains Evolved

> ...
> 
> ... The very last area to mature is the prefrontal cortex, where planning and judgment take place. (This explains why middle and high school students can sometimes behave in surprisingly immature ways.)
> 
> 
> ![Teacher-Directed vs Student-Directed](/.attachments/teacher-directed.vs.student-directed.jpg)
> 
> _Often, teacher-directed instruction and student-directed instruction are viewed as opposing methodologies. But in practice, teacher-directed instruction sets students up for successful student-directed learning. The more difficult (biologically secondary) the material, the more that students need coaching (teacher-directed approaches) to launch them toward independence (student-directed approaches). As students strengthen their neural links, they gain autonomy in their learning._
> 
> In teacher-directed learning, the _teacher_ leads the lesson and scaffolds instruction until the students master the material. You can think of the teacher as a movie director who uses scripts to provide actors with lines and side notes—giving them cues for placement and sometimes heartfelt examples to elicit emotion. Like the best directors, the best teachers are hands-on, straightforward, watchful, and explicit. But good learning, of course, goes beyond a script—it ultimately involves improv that the students can do on their own. The teacher’s support should gradually fade as students experience more and more success.
> 
> Direct instruction is often used synonymously with _teacher-directed learning_. Teachers frequently refer to it as “I do, we do, you do.” The teacher introduces new content or skills and provides students with expert guidance. New or difficult information is broken into easier, more digestible segments so as not to overwhelm students, and the teacher supervises students as they work toward proficiency.
> 
> Direct instruction uses the _learn it_, _link it_ approach to teaching. During the _learn it_ phase, the teacher presents new concepts or skills (“I do”), and scattered neurons search to make connections. But direct instruction doesn’t stop at the teacher explaining the concept. That would be a simple lecture, which doesn’t form lasting links between neurons. Instead, in direct instruction, the teacher explains the new content with different examples and demonstrations, as students follow along and get plenty of chances to practice. During practice, the teacher vigilantly offers corrective feedback (This is the “We do” stage). So the _learn it_ phase encompasses both the “I do” and “We do” stages of direct instruction.
> 
> ...
> 
> **PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION**
> 
> The following list by educational psychologist Barak Rosenshine9 provides a good overview of what effective teacher-directed instruction entails. (You probably already use these strategies on a regular basis.)
> 
> - Begin a lesson with a short review of previous learning.
> 
> - Present new material in small steps, with student practice after each step.
> 
> - Limit the amount of material students receive at one time.
> 
> - Give clear and detailed instructions and explanations.
> 
> - Ask a large number of questions and check for understanding.
> 
> - Provide a high level of active practice with many examples for all students.
> 
> - Guide students as they begin to practice.
> 
> - Think aloud and model steps.
> 
> - Provide models of worked-out problems.
> 
> - Ask students to explain what they have learned.
> 
> - Check the responses of all students.
> 
> - Provide systematic feedback and corrections.
> 
> - Reteach material when necessary.
> 
> - Prepare students for independent practice.
> 
> - Monitor students when they begin independent practice.

> ***Direct Instruction Versus Lecture and Other Forms of Passivity***
> 
> A Charlie Brown cartoon provides testimony to the ineffectiveness of lecture. Charlie’s teacher is providing a wealth of knowledge to her students, but all they hear is _“wah waaah wah wah . . .”_ This is not to say listening and watching are useless in learning. Listening to a presentation can involve intense cognitive processing. The processing can be so intense, in fact, that it doesn’t take long for students to tire and tune out. That’s why listening to a lecture—sometimes described as “talk and chalk”—is called a passive activity. Students may look attentive but not be following at all.
> 
> How can lectures be transformed into direct instruction? The teacher chunks carefully thought-out nuggets containing the key ideas of a lecture into short snippets. These brief golden nuggets of information are then interspersed with plenty of retrieval, practice, small-group discussion, and other ways of allowing the student to work more actively with the material than just listening and watching.
> 
> ...
> 
> Teachers also want to avoid extended passivity by allowing students to watch or listen to lengthy videos or audio texts.* While it may seem like a great break for students to watch _Hamlet_ after reading and analyzing the play (not to mention giving you a chance to catch up on grading), it can be a waste of precious instructional time. The last thing parents want to hear when they ask their child what they did at school today is “We watched a movie.” They can do that at home. Likewise, off-task behaviors sneak in when students are watching or listening passively.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Direct Instruction Versus Student-Directed Approaches***
> 
> ...
> 
> In a student-directed approach, students are treated like experts who investigate, discover, and construct their own meanings. In this case, the teacher provides the students with the necessary materials for learning but holds back on providing specific guidance, information, or answers.
> 
> ...
> 
> All too often, student-directed approaches are begun too early when teaching specific materials. Novice learners can find themselves easily frustrated because they are put in situations where they have to try to teach themselves complex material they may be only vaguely familiar with. The truth is, when it comes to concepts learned declaratively, students can take over the wheel to drive their own learning only after they understand the rules of the road and can implement proper driving techniques.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Why is Direct Instruction Necessary?***
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Discovery-based learning can be useful after difficult concepts and skills are mastered. But when it comes to introducing more difficult material without careful teacher guidance, students can become lost in the forest. Hiker students with lesser-capacity working memories generally suffer the most.
> 
> This is a point, however, where we should clarify. A working memory with lesser capacity is not a drawback. It’s just a difference that means other approaches to teaching and learning are required. Coauthor Barb’s lesser-capacity working memory, for example, provides the fuel that underpins her creative success. Does she have to work harder sometimes to master new material? Yes. But she feels that her hiker brain allows her to see the world with fresh perspectives that her larger-capacity working memory colleagues can overlook.
> 
> Is it possible to provide too much guidance? Yes. Students suffer when we let them off the hook for learning. There is something of a delicate dance related to resiliency. If parents or teachers are overly helpful, students may learn that admitting defeat gets their work done for them, either by their parents around the kitchen table or by the teacher the next day, who says, “That’s okay. At least you tried.” This, again, is why direct instruction to scaffold students toward the answers without simply giving them the answers is so valuable.

## Chapter 6. Active Learning. The Procedural Pathway

> There are two major routes in the neocortex that information travels into and out of to get to long-term memory. Each pathway makes up a separate learning system—the _declarative_ and the _procedural_.
> 
> ...
> 
> The procedural system is the basis of habitual actions. This type of learning has often been thought of as very different from the type of material learned in school. In fact, beginning with the cognitive revolution in the 1960s, the importance of habit-related procedural learning basically fell out of fashion. It is only recently that the study of procedural learning has been making a comeback. A comeback, that is, except in education. This chapter is meant to help rectify that.
> 
> ...
> 
> Working memory doesn’t create procedural sets of links. But it can grab them once they’re created. Once working memory grabs the procedural links, you can become conscious of them, or at least the essential aspects of them, if not the tiny details (for example, you can consciously turn right on your bicycle, but you’re not thinking of the muscle detail of turning right on the bicycle). Becoming more consciously aware through working memory, it seems, moves you toward the declarative system. Perhaps this is why when you become consciously aware of the motion of your free throw in basketball, or of your golf swing, or the aim of an arrow you are shooting with a bow, it can throw off your aim. “Be one with the arrow” may be a simple call to stay with the procedural rather than the declarative system so your thoughts can flow more swiftly and smoothly.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... This, indeed, is why a novice knitter or crocheter is focused declaratively on learning to handle the yarn, while an expert knitter can chat happily away while knitting.
> 
> ...
> 
> Teaching through the procedural system means giving students plenty of practice. Practice takes time—that’s why procedural is slower than declarative learning. But as we’ll see, once something’s been learned through the procedural system, it can be processed and performed more rapidly and automatically than knowledge formed by the declarative system.
> 
> ...
> 
> In a related vein, “unlearning” knowledge built from personal observation and “common knowledge” is perhaps one of the most challenging aspects of learning in many different fields, including physics, psychology, law, and business. The difficulty may well be because the unlearning involves (mis)information that has been learned procedurally. The common approach recommended for unlearning is plenty of practice with the new ideas—and practice, of course, is a foundation of procedural learning.
> 
> You can think of the two memory systems as a sort of seesaw. Emphasizing one system de-emphasizes the other.8 But once each system learns the information, this knowledge becomes complementary: each way of knowing enhances your overall understanding of and ability to work with the material.
> 
> ...
> 
> When Terry was a college physics major learning electricity and magnetism, he memorized Maxwell’s equations, which were derived from many experiments with batteries and magnets. Did he understand electricity and magnetism? No, because it was not until he had to apply the equations to a problem, like designing a radio antenna, that he learned their consequences. By using procedural learning to solve many different problems in electricity and magnetism, Terry formed intuitions about what the equations really meant, how to use Maxwell’s equations, and how to solve new problems quickly.
> 
> ...
> 
> Since the information you’ve learned doesn’t need to go through your working memory (which is why you’re not conscious of this type of thinking), you can solve the cube more quickly.9 But it can also mean that even though you know how to solve the cube (which you do procedurally), you can’t easily explain it (which you would have to do declaratively).

I think this explains the reason persons who don't know how to read and write are able to fix things. Like mechanics that develop intuition without reading and writing.

> Let’s go back to your trip home in the car, which you accomplished mindlessly. Were you able to do that in the first few weeks after you moved into your home? No. You could get home, but you had to pay attention to what you were doing because you were using your conscious, declarative system. Only after you’d driven home many times did your procedural learning system master the information. Once it did, though, you could drive home without being consciously aware of it. But if the car in front of you suddenly comes to an unexpected stop, your procedural system will quickly stop your own car while simultaneously signaling working memory to shift its attention to your surroundings so you can consciously figure out what to do next.
> 
> Declarative learning gets students off the ground faster but with poorer overall performance. Learning declaratively and procedurally means that students can be fast and flexible with their knowledge. Explicit instruction, with its series of sequential, clear, step-by-step actions, increases learning in declarative memory. _Lack_ of explicit instruction can enhance learning through procedural memory. For example, a child can learn his native language procedurally without explicit, formal instruction.
> 
> ...
> 
> Interleaving is when students mix up their practice of a topic, rather than merely repeating virtually identical materials and questions all in one block of time. For example, if you were studying impressionism, blocked practice would mean you are exposed to, say, five paintings by Monet, then five each by Degas, Renoir, and Pissarro, a little like this: MMMMMDDDDDRRRRRPPPPP. But interleaved practice would mean you’d mix up the different artists as you were studying, so your studies might look more like MMDDRRPPMDRPMDRPMDRP.
> 
> ...
> 
> If you’re teaching math, you may wish to interleave, for example, calculations involving area, perimeter, and volume randomly. In this way, students don’t get so used to doing one type of formula that it becomes the first and perhaps only formula that comes to mind when they must solve a problem.
> 
> ...
> 
> We’ve arrived at last at the other “desirable difficulties” approach to teaching and creating neural links in long-term memory: _spaced repetition_. Spaced repetition, like the closely related technique of retrieval practice, may assist not only with declarative but also with procedural learning.
> 
> When you first learn a concept, your brain is struggling to make the connections. It makes those connections any way it can. Often, the connections aren’t necessarily the best configuration of neurons to capture the essence of what you’re learning.
> 
> The best way to allow those connections to rearrange themselves and make simpler, better, deeper, stronger connections is to take a break. Then return repeatedly to the concept. Returning over time is the essence of spaced repetition, and underlies the brain’s ability to consolidate the information ... This revisiting may even allow links created by the procedural system and other links created by the declarative system to find ways to connect if they relate to the same concept.
> 
> How long should the spacing between repetitions be—minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months? Sadly, there are no easy answers—except that we know sleep and moments of mental relaxation, along with the simple passage of time, can help. If students wish to remember the material for an upcoming test a week away, they should review it every day in the preceding week. If you want students to retain the content because you’d like them to know it in a year, it’s a good idea to review once every three weeks.
> 
> ...
> 
> Excessive homework—three to four hours a night—has become a contentious issue, causing some schools to eliminate homework altogether. Sadly, this throws the baby out with the bathwater. Judicious amounts of homework allow students to reinforce their declarative understanding of the material and to develop their self-regulatory skills. Perhaps most important, however, homework can be one of the best approaches to enable students to develop their procedural understanding of the material, as it allows for both spaced repetition and interleaving.
> 
> When it comes to homework, less is more. It’s about the quality of your assignments, not necessarily the quantity. If students are required to spend too much time on homework, they are bound to grow bored and be resistant to completing it. Instead of assigning forty homework problems, try seven. To incorporate interleaving and spaced repetition, assign (for example) two problems from today’s lesson, three problems from the previous lesson, and two problems from the distant past.
> 
> Is there a sweet spot for the time students at different ages should spend on homework for specific subjects? Unfortunately, not that research has so far revealed. We may never have a precise answer to the “optimal homework” question for each individual. The truth is, it all goes back to the quality of the assignment and the students’ motivation. A reasonable guideline is that biologically secondary material like math, reading, and writing, with their need for dramatic neural rewiring, would probably benefit the most from homework practice. Short daily practice helps much more than longer sessions scheduled days apart.
> 
> ...
> 
> The parents’ attitude toward homework is critical. Students must be allowed to struggle and receive only judicious guidance and hints, rather than for parents to hover continually, control, and correct. In this sense, parents of limited educational backgrounds but positive attitudes toward learning and homework can be beneficial for students in developing their own metacognitive skills.
> 
> Students often want to zip through homework as quickly as possible. When a task takes longer, they typically don’t want to take the time to battle through it. They may say they tried and couldn’t do it. The teacher then helps them out—which is, of course, classic enabling behavior. Your best strategy as you supply homework practice for your students is to give frequent short assignments based on an interleaved approach.
> 
> ...
> 
> Some students may understand a concept through their procedural system—for example, involving a point of grammar or the simplification of fractions—but find it challenging to put their understanding into words.* Students with poor working memories, who often learn through their hiker-like procedural systems, can become frustrated and feel disenfranchised when a teacher might insist that declarative explanations are the only way to demonstrate knowledge. Repeatedly asking a student who, say, might have some aspect of autism spectrum disorder to put their understanding into words—that is, to explain by using their declarative system—can shut that student down when it comes to school and classroom learning. It may also be a surprising example of the expertise reversal effect. The student can truly understand the content but become demotivated by being forced to slowly limp through confusing verbal explanations of material they already grasp intuitively. Students are individuals, and sometimes good teaching means understanding that if a student knows how to get the right answer, and they’re enjoying the material, that’s enough.

## Chapter 7. Building Community Through Habits

> ...
> 
> Even before the first day of school, you can begin establishing a welcoming and productive classroom climate. When students have an idea of what to expect, it reduces distress (the bad part of stress).[^2] It allows for eustress—the healthy anticipatory stress of an exciting new experience or accomplishment.[^3]
> 
> Plan to send a message to students and parents introducing yourself and letting students know what to anticipate on the first day. Your message should also contain intriguing descriptions of what is to come. (Think of it as the blurb for a much-anticipated thriller. This isn’t the time for a boring description or a set of objectives.) Your letter should ease students’ anxieties and give them a heads-up on any supplies needed.
> 
> ...
> 
> Students’ brains estimate, moment by moment, what kind of reward might be in the offing. (A reward is something a person perceives as positive, whether it’s an object, an action, or an internal feeling.) Most of the time, life just moves along for students as a predictable routine. So unless something like a chocolate bar or a roller coaster magically appears, students’ brains just sit around, doing usual brain stuff. But if an unexpected reward appears, dopamine squirts into many of the areas of the brain involved in learning. This dopamine not only makes students feel good but also allows connections between neurons to strengthen more easily. And remember that competitive, seesaw behavior between the declarative and procedural systems? It turns out that dopamine temporarily puts a halt to the competition and instead enables the two systems to work together.
> 
> In other words, dopamine from unexpected rewards helps students learn!
> 
> Dopamine reinforces actions that lead to desirable results. Here’s how it can play out. If fourth-grade students are sitting at their desks while their teacher is shuffling papers, there’s little expectation of a reward coming any time soon (the end of the school day may seem eons away). If the teacher asks all the students to line up according to their number, well, no big deal. The students begin to line up.
> 
> But if, as all the students begin to line up, the teacher provides positive reinforcement, saying, “Isn’t it great to get out of our seats and get our blood flowing? Let’s add a stretch to the sky or give yourself a hug,” with an infectiously upbeat, encouraging voice—this is unexpected. And the teacher’s cheerful voice, along with the ability to get out of their seats, is rewarding! The unexpected positive reward doesn’t just hit the brain’s pleasure centers. Dopamine also surges in many areas of the brain involved in learning. In addition, dopamine can make a dramatic improvement in working memory. Students learn that lining up feels good—_and they also more easily learn to line up_.
> 
> Let’s contrast this with Ms. Guided’s handling of her students when she is teaching them to line up. She expects them to be able to line up—after all, she sees it already in her mind, and it’s quite simple. But when students don’t line up the way she wants the first time (it’s confusing for kids, after all), she begins yelling at them. Suddenly, the kids’ expectations plunge from ho-hum to negative. Dopamine levels unexpectedly plunge, too, as dopamine neurons quit pumping it out. Kids’ abilities to learn decline right along with the decline in dopamine levels. Students’ brains react in an “unlearning” way—the sudden lowering of dopamine signals neurons to _disconnect_ rather than _connect_.
> 
> The result? Ms. Guided is even less satisfied with her seemingly difficult students, who don’t seem to be able to learn even something simple, like how to line up. But the students have learned something—that Ms. Guided is associated with negative feelings. Lining up also becomes affiliated with negative emotions, so kids drag their feet even more. Ms. Guided becomes even more upset. She wonders why she got such bad students again this year, while Ms. Duwell’s students always seem so much smarter and more well-behaved. (In an important sense, Ms. Duwell’s students _are_ smarter simply because of the environment she has created. Frequent dopamine boosts keep her students’ synapses snappily connecting with their new learning.)
> 
> ...
> 
> The critical point here is that rewards must be _unexpected_ if they are to promote the neural rewiring of learning. An _expected_ reward, such as time with a video game after finishing a homework assignment, may assist with _motivation_, but not with learning. Dopamine, it seems, is not released following an expected reward because there is no need for rewiring the synapses. After all, the brain is already correctly predicting the reward.15 An odd side effect of all of this is that being too positive all the time means your positive comments become expected—which means your positivity doesn’t work as well as you might like to enhance your students’ learning.
> 
> ... Practice helps with the development of schemas, and schemas make learning easier. As brain scientists Szu-Han Wang and Richard Morris point out, “Once built, relevant new information can be assimilated into schema very rapidly. We rapidly remember what interests us, but what interests us takes time to develop.”
> 
> Expected rewards do provide motivation—sometimes powerfully so, as with the rewarding break at the end of a Pomodoro session.17 Or sometimes less powerfully, as when the reward is in the distant future. The brain’s ability to discount the motivation of a reward that is delayed in time is called temporal discounting. ...
> 
> A challenge with an expected reward is that it is sometimes not what you think it is. Students’ need for social acceptance by their peers, for example, can be far more rewarding than understanding what’s being taught, pleasing their parents by getting a good grade, or receiving a trinket like a novelty pencil or sticker. If students want to feel accepted (and thus rewarded) by fellow students in social groups that disparage learning, they may deliberately choose to avoid their schoolwork.
> 
> Some students are naturally motivated to succeed in traditional schooling. Others may be discouraged in their learning because they find it to be more difficult or their real rewards come from their peers, not their studies. As the old saying goes, when you are trying to flush out a source of corruption, follow the money. Similarly, in teaching, if you are trying to understand why a student has no motivation for learning, it’s best to “follow the reward” and to deduce what that student is truly seeking. Few of us teachers have the chops to become professional counselors or therapists, but sometimes it can help us to realize that the subject matter we cherish is not necessarily the be-all and end-all for our students.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Even great teachers can become frustrated when they realize that after all their teaching efforts, a student remains mainly oblivious to feedback. In these cases, small, unexpected rewards such as praise can backfire. They can stoke a student’s already inflated or misaligned self-image and make them even less likely to pay attention to much-needed learning and growth. ...
> 
> ...
> 
> **Proactive Measures to Prevent Student Resistance**
> 
> - Provide specific praise to individual students, groups, or the whole class as warranted. When you sprinkle in specific praiseworthy feedback, you build trust and rapport, and students are more open to learning from their mistakes.
> 
> - Reassure students, even when their responses are incorrect, to help establish trust and encourage students’ future participation.
> 
> - Teach students the benefits of failure (FAIL is the First Attempt in Learning) to normalize making errors and learning through mistakes. After all, we would be out of a job as teachers if students knew everything!
> 
> - Set students up for success by making sure they have the correct answer before calling on them in front of their peers. Circulating the room makes it easy to notice students’ responses prior to engaging the whole class.

## Chapter 8. Linking Learners

> **The Role of Stress in Learning**
> 
> We should dive now into one of the most important areas of teaching and life in general: stress. Stress comes in several varieties. _Chronic_ stress creates _distress_—the kind of stress you or your students have little control over, such as a bad boss, an ill family member, or a furtive classroom bully. This stress can have serious long-term consequences for your health, including the cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems.
> 
> On the other hand, _transient_ stress is the kind of stress experienced when you are studying for a test, reacting rapidly as a race-car driver, or taking the challenge of a demanding hike. Transient stress, which students have some control over, isn’t generally harmful to health—it is instead a eustress (good stress) that can improve cognition, working memory, and physical strength. The neural chemicals released by transient stress may explain why students are more efficient and focused when studying for a nerve-racking test rather than simply lounging around “studying” at their leisure. Transient stress also explains why the information you learned for a presentation in front of the entire school can stay with you for years.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Using Collaborative Learning to Build Social Skills and Buffer Stress Levels**
> 
> Developing habitual procedures, as we discussed in the previous chapter, is a natural way to build a positive classroom culture. But we teachers can go even deeper to encourage social skills by assigning occasional in-class assignments that simultaneously teach students effective collaborative learning strategies. Research indicates that the “social buffering” provided by _supportive_ group members can reduce a student’s skyrocketing stress hormone levels when they encounter new and difficult tasks. Supportive teammates, in other words, can keep stress hormones in the “happy middle” that allows for optimal learning.
> 
> We’ve emphasized the word supportive because when it comes to groups, obstructive group members can increase instead of reduce another student’s stress. Sometimes students can be obstructive even when they don’t mean to be. The challenge is that most students don’t walk into classrooms with the time management, conflict resolution, and communication skills required for high-performance group work. As thirteen-year-old Veronique Mintz explains in _The New York Times_:
> 
> "I go to a school that puts a big emphasis on collaborative learning; approximately 80 percent of our work is done in teacher-assigned groups of three to five students. This forces students who want to complete their assignments into the position of having to discipline peers who won’t behave and coax reluctant group members into contributing."
> 
> Yet well-done collaborative learning can provide opportunities to enhance students’ self-control, patience, social problem-solving skills, self-esteem, and emotional intelligence. Ultimately it can improve academic engagement. Many students feel less anxiety about participating in discussions with a smaller group than in front of the whole class, making collaborative learning groups an appealing instructional choice.
> 
> ...
> 
> Collaborative learning in groups allows for that practice—making it blend nicely with the “We do” stage of direct instruction. For example, using think-pair-share[^1] provides students with a partner to practice retrieving newly learned material. It also eases students into developing social skills and taking responsibility for their own learning. After students have demonstrated proficiency with key concepts and skills, more student-directed collaborative learning tasks involving problem-solving can be effective.
> 
> ...
> 
> - **Disagree civilly**. Criticize ideas, not people.

The last bullet point reminds me of a quote credited to Eleanor Roosevelt, "Small minds discuss people, Average minds discuss events and Great minds discuss ideas"

> **The Uncommon Sense Trade-offs of Group Work**
> 
> Teamwork is an integral part of a well-functioning society, but individual contributions can also be valuable. As Suparna Rajaram, a professor of psychology at Stony Brook University, observes: “Psychologists have found that people working in larger groups tend to generate fewer ideas than when they work in smaller groups, or when working alone, and become less receptive to ideas from outside.”
> 
> This is why we like the idea of _brainwriting_. In this process, participants first brainstorm individually, writing down their ideas without judging them. The group then comes together, shares all their ideas, and proceeds to a second stage of conventional brainstorming to augment the combined list.
> 
> In the end, research on millions of scientific papers and patents has shown that large teams are vitally important in developing areas of science and technology that have already been conceived. But it is individuals working alone, or at most in tiny teams of two or three, who are essential in innovative, creative advances. Every person added to a team reduces the potential that the work is a genuinely creative breakthrough. Good teaching develops students’ abilities in both group and individual work.

## Chapter 9 Online Teaching with Personality and Flair

> One major university system, which we’ll leave unnamed, spent $2 million to produce a series of eight online courses. The course had beautiful videography, followed all the proper pedagogical rules—and was dull as dirt. Few bothered to enroll, so the university eventually opted to shut it down.
> 
> On the other hand, our massive open online course “Learning How to Learn” was made by amateurs who dodged the sounds of lawnmowers and meowing cats and constructed the course in a basement for virtually no money at all. In fact, “Learning How to Learn” has garnered millions of students and rave reviews despite (or perhaps because of) its corny, not professionally edited videos, along with well-organized quizzes, discussion forums, and course materials.
> 
> The moral of the story is that you don’t need to be an experienced technology professional or have unlimited financial resources to use tools that transform your online teaching from good to great. The teaching approaches you’ve already become familiar with in this book also work well online: including retrieval practice, active learning, and direct instruction. No surprise here—after all, the brain is the same, whether learning online or in a conventional classroom.
> 
> But there are even more brain-related pointers that will put your online teaching on a sound pedagogical footing. You’ll find that if you design your online materials in ways that align with how the brain learns, you will sometimes be able to teach online students even better than you do your face-to-face students. Online learning provides for self-paced learning, which allows you to differentiate your instruction effectively. On top of all that, online teaching can improve your face-to-face teaching—we’ll show you how.
> 
> The online learning experience has been shown to be just as good as face-to-face—sometimes even better. (Surprisingly often, studies “proving” that online learning isn’t as good as face-to-face use laughably inadequate techniques for conveying the information online—precisely the approaches we will help you avoid.) Many teachers swear that flipped classes—a combination of online and face-to-face—are the best of all worlds.
> 
> ...
> 
> In contrast, _asynchronous_ teaching involves creating materials and posting them on your school’s learning management system (LMS) so that students can access them at their convenience. Documents, videos, quizzes, discussion forums—all can be uploaded to support learning. But how do you keep students from procrastinating? And how do you know which types of materials are most useful for learners?
> 
> ...
> 
> Before diving into the structure of creating an excellent online experience for students, it’s worthwhile to touch on something called _multimedia learning theory_. The basic idea is straightforward. A picture with an accompanying verbal explanation can help students grasp a concept much more quickly than either a picture or a verbal explanation alone. This is because working memory typically has both a hearing and a seeing component (these are the _multi_ parts of multimedia theory). Simultaneously using both visual and verbal explanations allows students to make better use of their limited working memory.
> 
> ![Octopus handling chain link](/.attachments/teacher-hear.and.see.jpg)
> 
> _Working memory has both a hearing and a seeing component (symbolized here by the different shades of the arms of the “attentional octopus” you met in previous chapters). If you teach so that students simultaneously hear and see what you are explaining, it’s much easier for students to engage with the ideas (sets of neural links)._
> 
> Educational psychologist Richard Mayer has spent decades studying best practices for teaching in a multimedia format.7 Many of his findings also relate to face-to-face teaching. Here’s a list of what we find to be the most important insights from Mayer’s work, along with some of our additions and thoughts:
> 
> - **Speak clearly and enthusiastically**. Remember that students have enough negativity and boredom in their lives, so they are looking to you for upbeat inspiration. When making a prerecorded video, try to speak relatively quickly—around 150 to 185 words per minute. (Students can always stop the video if they need to think about what you just said; if you speak too slowly, students will become bored and more easily distracted.) Synchronous sessions are prone to problematic audio, so you want to ask questions and introduce other excuses for pauses to make sure the students are staying with you. Enunciate clearly—this is especially helpful for non-native speakers of English.
> 
> - **Introduce complex material gradually and highlight important information**. Complicated images should appear part by part, and arrows or highlights should draw students’ attention to what you’re explaining. Drawing arrows or circles is easy to do if you have a pen and tablet hooked into your computer.
> 
> - **Get rid of extraneous on-screen material**. Do you really need that entire graphic of the complexities of photosynthesis? Or all that verbiage in the bullet points? Or that busy bookcase in the background?8 You can place very brief phrases on the screen to emphasize what you are saying in words. But don’t put a long paragraph of text on the screen and then read it aloud. Rather than reinforcing learning, this simultaneous reading/seeing of the same information interferes with it.
> 
> - **When you are in front of the camera, you need to be bold and bigger than life**. Use your hands and an expressive set of facial emotions. It can be useful to think of the camera as a device that automatically subtracts ten charisma points. So you need to be extra outgoing to compensate. Don’t worry if talking to the camera seems unnatural at first; just think of the camera and its light as a supportive friend. If need be, put a stuffed animal on top of the camera. (It might help to know that if you watched Barb’s first online videos, you would have thought she was looking down the barrel of a shotgun.)
> 
> **Getting Started: Organizing Yourself and Your Students**
> 
> Your course should grow from your syllabus or class overview, which contains your expectations and schedule. The online layout of your course may seem simple and obvious to you, but for students, it can be bewildering—a little like being dumped blindfolded out of a car in the middle of the night and told to find their way home. Students need to form a _cognitive map_ that allows them to begin navigating your course. What’s a cognitive map? It’s a veritable zoo of neurons interconnected in a way that allows students to understand what they are supposed to do. For example, students must learn to click on the lower left corner of the web page to get to quizzes. Or the upper right for discussion forums. Once they have spent a little time navigating around your course, the newly formed cognitive map will start to become second nature.
> 
> To help students develop their new, course-related cognitive map, create a screencast (more on that soon) that walks them through the main elements of your course even as it also introduces you and your subject. In your screencast, point to the different key elements on your learning management system—the discussion forums, quizzes, and videos—and describe how students can best contact you. Students (and parents) appreciate one handy document that serves as a resource for the term or the year. Providing monthly event calendars can be an added bonus and is especially useful to parents and students in getting oriented in time as well as space.

> Upbeat and sparkly messages from you will solicit the best back from your students. Using emoticons helps prevent possible negative interpretations. Not to mention that emoticons along with Bitmojis can be fun! As students adjust to the shift in classroom environment, forgive their early technology failures, which will be inevitable.
> 
> ...
> 
> Video production experts like to say sound is 51 percent of the video, because without good sound, a video is worthless. Next time you are in a virtual meeting, listen to the difference—it’s very discernible—between a built-in laptop mic and a more professional microphone. Not paying attention to audio is a common mistake. People focus too much on how they look and not enough on how they sound.
> 
> ...
> 
> But there is an even more important aspect of audio quality—the tone and voice of the instructor. Some people have very mellifluous voices, while other voices can be gratingly difficult to listen to at any length. The irritating quality of these voices can arise because, among other factors, they can invoke memories of the angry shouts of your parents when you were getting into mischief, or the shrill shriek of someone in danger. Imagery even shows how these shrill voices can hijack the emotional circuitry of the amygdala, just as can other unpleasant sounds. Unfortunately, those with naturally higher-pitched voices can be particularly prone to screeches, since speaking nervously on camera can tighten the vocal cords still further, turning the high pitch into a grating one.
> 
> One often finds newscasters and politicians with high-pitched voices taking voice coaching. If you watch their videos over time, you can see how their pitch lowers and becomes more melodic. One good tip if you suspect you might have this problem is to start a sentence at a lower pitch than you normally would, to help keep the natural and gradual rise in your voice as you complete that sentence or paragraph from turning into a squeak.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Pointers for Going On-Camera**
> 
> Ordinarily, teachers sit in front of their computer or laptop and stream or videotape their image using their webcam. It can be helpful to follow the usual lighting rules, as shown in the following illustration. Place a stronger light, called a _key light_, in front of you, but slightly off to one side. A second lamp—the _fill light_—should be placed a bit farther away on the other side of you—or alternatively, be a bit dimmer—than the key light. This second light gets rid of shadows. If you want to make yourself pop out from the background, use a third light, called a _back light_. If all you have is the key light, place it right in front of you. Avoid having bright windows behind you; it can leave your viewers feeling as if they’re looking at your silhouette in the sun. If you wear glasses, you may need to play with the light a little to find a sweet spot with low glare. Avoid ring lights, which can leave devilish-looking circular reflections if you wear glasses. Flat panel LEDs are great. Sometimes simply raising the height of your lights can eliminate or reduce glare on glasses.
> 
> ![Camera Lighting](/.attachments/teacher-on-camera.lighting.jpg)
> 
> _A typical home video recording setup. You can use from one light to four lights. (Four lights are preferable for green screen, which makes it easy to substitute in another background.)_
> 
> Be sure to watch your positioning on the screen. What generally happens is you’ll sit up tall to start with, but then as you tire, you begin to slump, so you droop down on the lower part of the screen. You think it’s fine, because your head appears centered in the middle of the frame, but the problem is that your hand motions can be cut off below the camera frame. Some people set their laptops on boxes—it’s easier to be energetic and to make good use of hand gestures when you’re standing. Try to be conscious, at least at first, of where your hands are on screen. You want them to be visible, particularly when you are emphasizing important points. Thanks to your procedural system, with time, holding your hands in a visible yet natural position will become a habit and you won’t need to think about it.

> 
> _Barb models the common mistake of slumping down in her chair while centering her face in the frame (aka the prairie dog effect). This inadvertently cuts off her hands. She’s also overexposed—there is too much light hitting her face._
> 
> ![Good On-CameraExample](/.attachments/teacher-on-camera.good.jpg)
> 
> _Here, Terry’s head is perfectly positioned in the upper part of the frame (high up but without the Frankenstein effect of cutting off the top of the head). There is plenty of room in the lower part of the image frame for his hands._
> 
> Make sure any lights you use have the same type of bulb in them, so your camera doesn’t get confused. All this gives your image a full, real-tone look. It’s nice if your on-camera background tells a little about you. If you can, try to go beyond the usual bookcase in the background. But sometimes a bookcase is all you’ve got. If that’s so, go with it and display some of your favorite books. If the room is filled with hard walls and floors, try to add rugs and soft surfaces like blankets or cushions to minimize echoes.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Asynchronous Teaching**
> 
> Learning experts will sometimes say, “It’s interacting with one another that gets students engaged in the course.” Consequently, teachers work to liven up their asynchronous materials by using asynchronous supportive elements such as discussion forums, shared sticky notes, peer editing, and quizzes. These are indeed useful, and we’ll discuss them in this chapter. But the reality is, _students focus on videos_. And well-explained videos are one of the most powerful tools in all of teaching.
> 
> ...
> 
> You may think, Look at _Sal Khan of Khan Academy_—he never shows himself in his videos. This is true—but on the other hand, students generally go to his videos _voluntarily_. They’re already motivated to learn what he’s teaching, even if the motivation arises just because they can’t understand their teacher’s explanations. But your students are _not_ necessarily volunteering to take your class. Sharing your personality allows you to connect with and motivate your students—an essential first step in getting them to engage with the course materials.
> 
> ...
> 
> Basically, you want to break up the material into the smallest chunks possible but not so small that a student needs to watch multiple videos in a row to understand the concept. We recommend that if you’re constructing a set of online materials, whether as the mainstay or as a supplement for your class, these videos should each be about three to twelve minutes in length—that is, about the amount of time you would give an explicit piece of instruction. A shorter video “allows learners to engage with small pieces of new information and gives them control over the flow of new information.” Note that this doesn’t mean taking an hour-long video and snipping it into ten six-minute videos. It means taking a bit of care with each video so it has a very short introductory hook, a good explanation, and a wrap-up that places the idea in context. It’s amazing how often cutting a minute or two of material can fix the pacing.
> 
> ...
> 
> A challenge with lengthy videos, however, is that they can be a little like asking students to read encyclopedias. Even if you did lots of activities during, say, a synchronous session, once you transpose the session to video, it all just turns into a lengthy lecture. And we know how problematic extended lectures are for student learning! Even inserting interactive material like quiz questions into or after a long video does little to relieve the boredom.
> 
> Good visuals are an especially important part of video creation, and getting good visuals takes time. It may seem counterintuitive, but it’s worth noting that shorter videos demand extra planning and longer preparation time.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... If you find a way, for example, to add in a little something funny or unexpected every five to seven minutes, or at least once somewhere in each of your videos, students will start looking for that little unexpected dopamine boost of pleasure. This boost will allow them to power through the harder-to-grasp, sometimes boring stuff in between the bits of humor. Don’t worry if you don’t feel you have the comedic touch. Learning to add a bit of humor is like learning to ride a bike—you don’t have to be world class to get around.
> 
> A good source for laughter? Tiny snippets from movies, as well as memes and Bitmojis. ...
> 
> ...
> 
> **Assessment and Engagement**
> 
> ...
> 
> What we like about the online world of asynchronous quizzes is that these quizzes can be “just in time.” There is plenty of evidence that multiple-choice questions can do a good job of helping students learn. Many LMSs or tools like HapYak and Zaption allow you to embed quiz questions within a video, or immediately after a video. Frequent quiz questions can bring students’ attention back to the material and make a significant improvement in student performance. There is no hard-and-fast rule about when to add questions—some instructors tell entrancing stories in their videos, such that it doesn’t make sense to stop the flow with intrusive questions until the end. There are also tools like Edpuzzle or PlayPosit that can help you build a complete lesson around your video, and even track the data to see how well students are doing on your embedded questions.
> 
> ...
> 
> Discussion forums allow you to assess student knowledge of the material and give students practice retrieving the content in different contexts. Smaller discussion groups foster both familiarity and friendship. Questions that start with action verbs—like _find_, _explain_, _describe_, _identify_, and _compare_—make for an active and vibrant forum.
> 
> Make sure your questions don’t all elicit the same correct response. To ensure a variety of responses, ask students to find the three most important quotations from the assigned reading, and explain why they chose each. Then have them pair with another student to compare quotes and decide on one to share and defend with another group.

## Chapter 10. Charting your Course to the Finish Lines

> ...
> 
> Master teachers begin with the final destination in mind. Students achieve more when they know where they are going and what it looks like when they get there. Master teachers rely on the standards and eligible content for the essential vocabulary, skills, formulas, concepts, and patterns that students need to advance in the subject.
> 
> ...
> 
> Instead of taking on the entire world, narrow your itinerary—_prioritize the most essential_ knowledge and skills.
> 
> ...
> 
> Objectives state what students will know, understand, and be able to do. They set your goal for teaching and the students’ goal for learning, and establish what success looks like.
> 
> ...
> 
> Many teachers post their lesson’s objective on the board and state it at the start of class. An issue we’ve found with this approach is that students don’t respond particularly well to objectives. They see difficult-to-parse sentences and tune out. The solution? Try turning your objective into a lesson-based focus question. For example: _How does Poe use imagery to establish the mood in “The Tell-Tale Heart”?_
> 
> ...
> 
> Teachers and students alike know their final destination, but what proof do they have that they’ve reached it? Enter formative and summative assessments. Formative assessments are markers along the path that indicate a student’s progress. These quick informal assessment checks happen during instruction. They allow a teacher to gauge each student’s distance toward meeting the objective. When you think formative assessments, think retrieval practice. This practice offers students feedback on where they are going, the progress they have made, and where they are going next. Like a GPS system, when students take wrong turns, master teachers help their students “recalculate” and get back on route.
> 
> ...
> 
> **The Hook**
> 
> Not every student will be excited to learn what you are teaching. You need to capture their interest and make the lesson relevant. Just as with a good framing question for the lesson plan, a good hook can spur those spurts of dopamine and make what you are teaching stick. Good hooks provide anticipation of an _unexpected_ surprise payoff—which means your hooks should vary.[^4] (This isn’t easy, but who said teaching’s easy!) The good thing is that you can reuse your hooks from class to class or year to year, fine-tuning and improving them. You can also mine the gold you see in other teachers’ classrooms. If a colleague has a great hook, why not put it into action in your own classroom?
> 
> Effective hooks tap into what students already know and connect to the critical content you are about to teach. To hook our students into a math-based physics lesson, connect it to space travel focused on time, distance, and the task of getting astronauts to Mars. When you present a challenging real-life problem to solve, the students will be more enthusiastic (especially those students who dream of becoming astronauts!).
> 
> You can also think of hooks as trailers designed to get us to watch the movie. To hook our students into our lesson on how Poe uses imagery to create mood, for example, we may actually show the trailer of a current scary movie and ask students what images and effects make the trailer so terrifying. It helps if you model becoming excited when you watch the clip, even if you’ve seen that clip a dozen times before. Brief, one- to two-minute multimedia clips are particularly effective with our twenty-first-century learners. Be sure to establish the purpose for viewing the clip before hitting the play button. Follow up with a clear connection to the upcoming lesson.

> **The Lesson Body: Learn It, Link It**
> 
> Students generally learn unfamiliar _hard stuff_ best through the declarative pathway. In the declarative path, working memory delivers new information to the neocortex with the help of the hippocampus.
> 
> When we explain to our students what they are learning and demonstrate step by step what to do, we target the declarative pathway. Students _learn it_ during the initial phase of direct instruction: “I do, we do.” They are conscious of the new learning and are primed to begin the process of making connections between neurons.
> 
> As you transition into the body of the lesson, ease your students into the new material. Start by tapping into and building upon your students’ prior knowledge. Students may have a schema already in place for the concept you are about to teach. New information can be assimilated and stored rapidly when it is tied together with preexisting knowledge and experiences. If prior knowledge is nonexistent, now is the time for you to create it. Students need this transition time to acclimate because they can quickly become overwhelmed. It’s like diving right into the deep end of an ice-cold pool. Most people find it less jarring to wade in gradually. Ahead are several strategies and tips to consider as you lead your students into learning.

> It seems like common sense that the more content teachers cover, the more students learn. But as an uncommon sense teacher, you know this isn’t necessarily true. Some teachers take a deep breath, start talking, and keep talking and talking until the bell rings. While there is no definitive time limit on teacher talk, a good rule of thumb for elementary students is to teach for five minutes and pause for one minute of retrieval practice. For upper middle and high school students, teach ten minutes and spend two minutes retrieving the information. These pauses in your instruction are essential for speeding up the consolidation of neural links in the neocortex.

> The learning cycle repeats itself until students have become proficient with the foundational content and skills. Ideally this would occur at the same time for everyone—but that rarely ever happens. We know our hiker-type students will need extra practice and different levels of coaching or support, while our race-car-type students will be ready to move on to more independent student-directed learning activities. As students reach proficiency, they become ready to _link it_—where they work to reinforce and extend their neural links.
> 
> Oftentimes, students need to switch neural paths to _link it_. To make learning stick, the information that students have learned through their declarative pathway needs to be reinforced with the backup information in the procedural system. Information comes in through the senses to the basal ganglia and heads straight to the neocortex. Sounds quick and easy, right? Not so fast. We have learned that taking the procedural route often requires steady, repeated practice, and can take time.

> 
> Warning: Interleaving and spacing—the types of practice students need to link it—create desirable difficulties that students may resist. Students resist this type of practice because it is frustrating. It often leads to more errors during the learning process. Making sure students have a firm foundation during the _learn it_ stage of the lesson is key to reducing their anxiety when they _link it_.

> Instead of telling your students what they have learned (after all, you already know this), have _them_ tell _you_. Call on multiple students throughout the room. When they use new vocabulary, ask another student to tell you what it means and provide examples. When they tell you what they did, ask follow-up questions: What did you learn? How does it build upon your previous knowledge? How will you use this knowledge or skill? Have another student and then another add to each response to build comprehensive answers.

> At the end of a unit or project, look back and consider the learning _process_. One quick method to have students examine their path and performance is to have them complete a _glows_ and _grows_ T-chart. Glows and grows offers a balanced approach to feedback, where one side of the T-chart is labeled _Glows_ and the other side is labeled _Grows_. Glows provide students with an opportunity to comment on areas where they shined. They concentrate on the strides they’ve made in their learning, especially in skills they were previously lacking. On the other side of the T, students write about the bumps and roadblocks they encountered along their path and what they did to move forward. Growth requires development in learning—but sometimes there is still a discrepancy between the progress the student made and the distance yet to travel to master the objective. Using what they have written in the growth column, students can create new goals for themselves.

The quiet think time of think-pair-share may be particularly useful for hippocampal offloading, especially if students take a brief mental breather before they begin to focus on the task at hand.

[^2]: “Stress may lead to stronger memories for negative events happening in the classroom, such as failed exams, embarrassing experiences or interpersonal conflicts (e.g., bullying) and these strong negative memories may induce long-lasting frustration and a negative attitude towards school and the individual’s abilities. . . . Stress may hinder the integration of new information into existing knowledge structures, which may prevent the updating of new facts or a deep multidisciplinary understanding of concepts which is often required in education.” Vogel and Schwabe, 2016.
