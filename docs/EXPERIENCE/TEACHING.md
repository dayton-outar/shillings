_Practival Insights in Brain Science to Help Students Learn_

## Chapter 1. Building Memory

> _Long-term memory_ is what it sounds like—it holds the information we’re able to store and bring back to mind from weeks, months, or even years before. As we’ve seen, you can think of long-term memory as sets of neural links that students have developed when they’ve learned the material well. As we also mentioned previously, these neural links congregate in the neocortex—the thin sheet of neural tissue that rides over the ridges and deep grooves of the brain’s surface. If we reinforce the links of long-term learning through varied practice, our learning is generally in good shape. (By varied practice, we mean not just practicing with the same material. For example, you don’t want to just sit around testing yourself on lists of new foreign language vocabulary words. You also want to use those new words in a variety of different sentences and contexts.)
> 
> But _working memory_—that temporary holding pattern for thoughts—is different from long-term memory. Rather than sets of links that reside happily in the neocortex, working memory is more like an octopus tossing a set of balls. These balls represent thoughts that bounce over and over again from the front to the back of your brain, as long as you are holding the ideas in working memory. An average working memory can hold up to four “balls” before ideas begin slipping from the mind, as you can see in the “quadropus” on this page. (Incidentally, students can’t grow more arms on their octopuses. But the more students practice with the material, the bigger the balls of information can become. More on this soon.)

> But getting the information into long-term memory can be difficult. We’ll be exploring this vital topic in more detail in chapter 3. The key idea, however, is that retrieval practice is one of the best techniques for strengthening new information in long-term memory.10 Retrieval practice means drawing ideas you’re starting to learn from your own mind rather than simply looking at the answer. Good examples of retrieval practice include using flash cards or merely looking away from a page to see if you can retrieve the key idea or ideas on the page.

## Chapter 2. Teacher Inclusively

> Nobel Prize–winning economist Friedrich Hayek, for example, observed that unlike his swift-learning colleagues, his innovative breakthroughs came from his slow, muddling struggle to grasp the material. Being forced to find his own way of expressing accepted ideas allowed him to see gaps and unjustified assumptions that others missed.

> 
> _Often, teacher-directed instruction and student-directed instruction are viewed as opposing methodologies. But in practice, teacher-directed instruction sets students up for successful student-directed learning. The more difficult (biologically secondary) the material, the more that students need coaching (teacher-directed approaches) to launch them toward independence (student-directed approaches). As students strengthen their neural links, they gain autonomy in their learning._
> 
> In teacher-directed learning, the _teacher_ leads the lesson and scaffolds instruction until the students master the material. You can think of the teacher as a movie director who uses scripts to provide actors with lines and side notes—giving them cues for placement and sometimes heartfelt examples to elicit emotion. Like the best directors, the best teachers are hands-on, straightforward, watchful, and explicit. But good learning, of course, goes beyond a script—it ultimately involves improv that the students can do on their own. The teacher’s support should gradually fade as students experience more and more success.
> 
> Direct instruction is often used synonymously with _teacher-directed learning_. Teachers frequently refer to it as “I do, we do, you do.” The teacher introduces new content or skills and provides students with expert guidance. New or difficult information is broken into easier, more digestible segments so as not to overwhelm students, and the teacher supervises students as they work toward proficiency.
> 
> Direct instruction uses the _learn it_, _link it_ approach to teaching. During the _learn it_ phase, the teacher presents new concepts or skills (“I do”), and scattered neurons search to make connections. But direct instruction doesn’t stop at the teacher explaining the concept. That would be a simple lecture, which doesn’t form lasting links between neurons. Instead, in direct instruction, the teacher explains the new content with different examples and demonstrations, as students follow along and get plenty of chances to practice. During practice, the teacher vigilantly offers corrective feedback (This is the “We do” stage). So the _learn it_ phase encompasses both the “I do” and “We do” stages of direct instruction.

> 
> The following list by educational psychologist Barak Rosenshine9 provides a good overview of what effective teacher-directed instruction entails. (You probably already use these strategies on a regular basis.)
> 
> - Begin a lesson with a short review of previous learning.
> 
> - Present new material in small steps, with student practice after each step.
> 
> - Limit the amount of material students receive at one time.
> 
> - Give clear and detailed instructions and explanations.
> 
> - Ask a large number of questions and check for understanding.
> 
> - Provide a high level of active practice with many examples for all students.
> 
> - Guide students as they begin to practice.
> 
> - Think aloud and model steps.
> 
> - Provide models of worked-out problems.
> 
> - Ask students to explain what they have learned.
> 
> - Check the responses of all students.
> 
> - Provide systematic feedback and corrections.
> 
> - Reteach material when necessary.
> 
> - Prepare students for independent practice.
> 
> - Monitor students when they begin independent practice.

> ***Direct Instruction Versus Lecture and Other Forms of Passivity***
> 
> A Charlie Brown cartoon provides testimony to the ineffectiveness of lecture. Charlie’s teacher is providing a wealth of knowledge to her students, but all they hear is _“wah waaah wah wah . . .”_ This is not to say listening and watching are useless in learning. Listening to a presentation can involve intense cognitive processing. The processing can be so intense, in fact, that it doesn’t take long for students to tire and tune out. That’s why listening to a lecture—sometimes described as “talk and chalk”—is called a passive activity. Students may look attentive but not be following at all.
> 
> How can lectures be transformed into direct instruction? The teacher chunks carefully thought-out nuggets containing the key ideas of a lecture into short snippets. These brief golden nuggets of information are then interspersed with plenty of retrieval, practice, small-group discussion, and other ways of allowing the student to work more actively with the material than just listening and watching.
> 
> ...
> 
> Teachers also want to avoid extended passivity by allowing students to watch or listen to lengthy videos or audio texts.* While it may seem like a great break for students to watch _Hamlet_ after reading and analyzing the play (not to mention giving you a chance to catch up on grading), it can be a waste of precious instructional time. The last thing parents want to hear when they ask their child what they did at school today is “We watched a movie.” They can do that at home. Likewise, off-task behaviors sneak in when students are watching or listening passively.
