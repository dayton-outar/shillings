## Chapter 1. Why Seductive Interaction?

> ... we could look at several ideas from psychology:
> 
> - _Sequencing_. We are more likely to take action when complex tasks are broken down into smaller tasks.
> 
> - _Appropriate challenges_. We delight in challenges, especially ones that strike a balance between being overwhelming and being boring.
> 
> - _Status_. We constantly assess how interactions enhance or diminish our standing relative to others and our personal best.
> 
> - _Achievements_. We are more likely to engage in activities in which meaningful achievements are recognized.

> Maybe you have some outstanding feature requests, but nothing big. in fact, there’s nothing particularly wrong with what you’ve built. But, maybe you’ve observed some of these problems:
> 
> - High bounce rate: people come, but never come back.
> - Low adoption: people just aren’t using the service. Maybe it’s an enterprise app that only 10 percent of employees are using. Maybe it’s a startup with few active users.
> - Too few registered users: your measure of success is sign-ups or registered users, but people aren’t even doing this.
> - No differentiation from the competition: you’re in a crowded space and the differences between your product and others are too subtle.
> - Very few referrals: people just aren’t interested in telling their friends about you.
> - No clickthroughs on e-mail campaigns.
> 
> We could go on, but you get the idea. If your app could speak for itself, it might say: “I’m a great app, if people would just get to know me.”
> 
> ...
> 
> No one wants to sit and hear someone talk about themselves all night. The same is true in many online interactions.
> 
> ...
> 
> In almost every other sign-up process for a music site—or any site that wants to find out your personal favorites—there’s a page where you’re asked to list your favorite bands. i call it the big, empty text box.
> 
> And we dutifully list a handful of favorite bands (or movies, or hobbies, or what have you).
> 
> iLike, however, never gave me the chance to list my favorite bands. Instead, they showed me a page with 35 artists and simply asked me to “click on your favorite artists.” The Beatles. Radiohead. Coldplay. This was fun. I got to the bottom of the page and was presented with an option: I could be done with the registration process or click for more artists. Of course I clicked for more artists! In fact, I continued clicking on more of my favorite bands for nine pages, until “Click for more artists” wasn’t an option!
> 
> ...
> 
> So why did this work?
>
> - **Feedback loops**. We’re engaged by situations in which we see our actions modify subsequent results. iLike made a very small suggestion: “The more artists you rate, the better.” They were careful not to spell out when I’d see results; it could have been on the very next page that reloaded or three months down the road after I was an active user. That merely suggested that my actions would tailor my iLike experience.
>
> - **Curiosity**. When teased with a small bit of interesting information, people want to know more. I was curious: how would clicking on the artists I like affect results on the next page? Would I see less of one genre, and more of another? Would the suggestions become more personalized with each new batch of 35 artists?
>
> - **Pattern recognition**. Our brains seek ways to organize and simplify complex information, even where there is no pattern. I was looking to see if there was more or less of one type of artist. Also, why these 35 artists? Was there a pattern to the artists I was rating?
>
> - **Visual imagery**. Vision trumps all other senses and is the most direct way to perception. If you think about this page from a technical perspective, it’s nothing more than a list of 35 checkbox items. however, by using photographs of the artists, there was a more immediate, visceral reaction. And I had a larger click target.
>
> - **Recognition over recall**. It’s easier to recognize things we have previously experienced than it is to recall them from memory. Instead of having to recall bands I liked from memory, this was an easier, passive experience. All I had to do was click on artists I recognized and like. No mental strength was required. More importantly, my hand never left the mouse—it’s much easier to click from available options than to type things out by hand.
> 
> All in all, this was a remarkable sign-up process. But, my initial iLike experience wasn’t over yet.
> 
> About 15 minutes later, i was checking my e-mail. There was a confirmation e-mail to let me know that i had successfully created a profile on iLike. The e-mail suggested what i might do next. i could add a photo to my profile. not now, thanks. There was another plug for their iTunes plug-in. Meh. Or—and this is the one that piqued my interest—i could “Play the iLike Challenge.” i was curious. What was the iLike Challenge?
> 
> ...
> 
> The iLike Challenge presents you with a 30-second sample from a song. The challenge is to identify either the artist who wrote the song or the title of a song. You get points for answering accurately and quickly. For example, the challenge may be “name this gorillaz song,” and you have four options to choose from. If you answer in the first few seconds, you get ten points. If it takes five or six seconds to answer, you get nine points. The longer you take to answer, the fewer points you get. If it takes you 28 seconds to figure out what the song is, you’re only going to get one point! And if you answer incorrectly, you get no points. This game is fairly addictive in and of itself. It tests your knowledge of popular songs. And, with multiple-choice answers to choose from, you have some chance of guessing correctly. Here’s the part that’s particularly evil: visible on the side of the screen is a scoreboard that keeps track of how you’re doing.
> - Your current rank
> - Total points accumulated
> - Points to next rank (Remember progress dynamics? Here I only need 48 more points to reach the next level. Hmm. I wonder what’s after Music intern?)
> - Questions answered
> - Percentage of correct answers
> - Average answer time
>
> These are all fun metrics to monitor. But, here’s the one that really worked on me: Best streak. Best streak is the total number of points based on consecutively correct answers. Even if I did start to tire of the music game, there was another game introduced here, one in which I compete against my own personal best. if my best streak was 47, I had to beat that. And when I did, I’d set goals: can I get above 60? Above 100? All said, I spent over an hour playing this game. And then I shared it with friends and family. That’s a _seductive_ interaction.

> Why did this work? it would be easy to focus on the gaming mechanics: points, levels, a countdown timer. But why do game mechanics work? I devote several chapters of this book to answering that question. Recall four of the ideas you’ve already seen: _status_, _feedback loops_, _achievements_, and _appropriate challenges_. There is also the sensory appeal factor. We’re engaged by and more likely to recall things that appeal to multiple senses. Given the constraints of a digital context, it’s hard to engage multiple senses, but with the iLike Challenge, you have the artist’s visuals, the motion of a timer count ing down, the audio input, and the interaction required by a game.

> _It wasn’t a focus on usability that made this a great experience. It was psychology._
> 
> Usability clears the way for a good experience by eliminating troublesome interface distractions, but a great experience stems from something more—an awareness of why people could or do care. The danger is in confusing “ease of use” with actually desiring to use something. ... To be clear, if a business approached me tomorrow about making their time-tracking tool fun to use, I’d start by making sure it was first easy to use. Adding “playful” elements on top of a frustrating experience will only complicate things. ... However, I’ve seen cases where the motivation to do something outweighed the usability challenges—the pull outweighed the friction.
