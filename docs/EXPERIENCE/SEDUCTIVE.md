# Seductive Interaction Design

> Understanding human behavior is really the only way to make effective designs.

## Chapter 1. Why Seductive Interaction?

> ... we could look at several ideas from psychology:
> 
> - _Sequencing_. We are more likely to take action when complex tasks are broken down into smaller tasks.
> 
> - _Appropriate challenges_. We delight in challenges, especially ones that strike a balance between being overwhelming and being boring.
> 
> - _Status_. We constantly assess how interactions enhance or diminish our standing relative to others and our personal best.
> 
> - _Achievements_. We are more likely to engage in activities in which meaningful achievements are recognized.
> 
> ...
> 
> Maybe you have some outstanding feature requests, but nothing big. in fact, there’s nothing particularly wrong with what you’ve built. But, maybe you’ve observed some of these problems:
> 
> - High bounce rate: people come, but never come back.
> - Low adoption: people just aren’t using the service. Maybe it’s an enterprise app that only 10 percent of employees are using. Maybe it’s a startup with few active users.
> - Too few registered users: your measure of success is sign-ups or registered users, but people aren’t even doing this.
> - No differentiation from the competition: you’re in a crowded space and the differences between your product and others are too subtle.
> - Very few referrals: people just aren’t interested in telling their friends about you.
> - No clickthroughs on e-mail campaigns.
> 
> We could go on, but you get the idea. If your app could speak for itself, it might say: “I’m a great app, if people would just get to know me.”
> 
> ...
> 
> No one wants to sit and hear someone talk about themselves all night. The same is true in many online interactions.
> 
> ...
> 
> In almost every other sign-up process for a music site—or any site that wants to find out your personal favorites—there’s a page where you’re asked to list your favorite bands. i call it the big, empty text box.
> 
> And we dutifully list a handful of favorite bands (or movies, or hobbies, or what have you).
> 
> iLike, however, never gave me the chance to list my favorite bands. Instead, they showed me a page with 35 artists and simply asked me to “click on your favorite artists.” The Beatles. Radiohead. Coldplay. This was fun. I got to the bottom of the page and was presented with an option: I could be done with the registration process or click for more artists. Of course I clicked for more artists! In fact, I continued clicking on more of my favorite bands for nine pages, until “Click for more artists” wasn’t an option!
> 
> ...
> 
> So why did this work?
>
> - **Feedback loops**. We’re engaged by situations in which we see our actions modify subsequent results. iLike made a very small suggestion: “The more artists you rate, the better.” They were careful not to spell out when I’d see results; it could have been on the very next page that reloaded or three months down the road after I was an active user. That merely suggested that my actions would tailor my iLike experience.
>
> - **Curiosity**. When teased with a small bit of interesting information, people want to know more. I was curious: how would clicking on the artists I like affect results on the next page? Would I see less of one genre, and more of another? Would the suggestions become more personalized with each new batch of 35 artists?
>
> - **Pattern recognition**. Our brains seek ways to organize and simplify complex information, even where there is no pattern. I was looking to see if there was more or less of one type of artist. Also, why these 35 artists? Was there a pattern to the artists I was rating?
>
> - **Visual imagery**. Vision trumps all other senses and is the most direct way to perception. If you think about this page from a technical perspective, it’s nothing more than a list of 35 checkbox items. however, by using photographs of the artists, there was a more immediate, visceral reaction. And I had a larger click target.
>
> - **Recognition over recall**. It’s easier to recognize things we have previously experienced than it is to recall them from memory. Instead of having to recall bands I liked from memory, this was an easier, passive experience. All I had to do was click on artists I recognized and like. No mental strength was required. More importantly, my hand never left the mouse—it’s much easier to click from available options than to type things out by hand.
> 
> All in all, this was a remarkable sign-up process. But, my initial iLike experience wasn’t over yet.
> 
> About 15 minutes later, i was checking my e-mail. There was a confirmation e-mail to let me know that i had successfully created a profile on iLike. The e-mail suggested what i might do next. i could add a photo to my profile. not now, thanks. There was another plug for their iTunes plug-in. Meh. Or—and this is the one that piqued my interest—i could “Play the iLike Challenge.” i was curious. What was the iLike Challenge?
> 
> ...
> 
> The iLike Challenge presents you with a 30-second sample from a song. The challenge is to identify either the artist who wrote the song or the title of a song. You get points for answering accurately and quickly. For example, the challenge may be “name this gorillaz song,” and you have four options to choose from. If you answer in the first few seconds, you get ten points. If it takes five or six seconds to answer, you get nine points. The longer you take to answer, the fewer points you get. If it takes you 28 seconds to figure out what the song is, you’re only going to get one point! And if you answer incorrectly, you get no points. This game is fairly addictive in and of itself. It tests your knowledge of popular songs. And, with multiple-choice answers to choose from, you have some chance of guessing correctly. Here’s the part that’s particularly evil: visible on the side of the screen is a scoreboard that keeps track of how you’re doing.
> - Your current rank
> - Total points accumulated
> - Points to next rank (Remember progress dynamics? Here I only need 48 more points to reach the next level. Hmm. I wonder what’s after Music intern?)
> - Questions answered
> - Percentage of correct answers
> - Average answer time
>
> These are all fun metrics to monitor. But, here’s the one that really worked on me: Best streak. Best streak is the total number of points based on consecutively correct answers. Even if I did start to tire of the music game, there was another game introduced here, one in which I compete against my own personal best. if my best streak was 47, I had to beat that. And when I did, I’d set goals: can I get above 60? Above 100? All said, I spent over an hour playing this game. And then I shared it with friends and family. That’s a _seductive_ interaction.
> 
> ...
> 
> Why did this work? it would be easy to focus on the gaming mechanics: points, levels, a countdown timer. But why do game mechanics work? I devote several chapters of this book to answering that question. Recall four of the ideas you’ve already seen: _status_, _feedback loops_, _achievements_, and _appropriate challenges_. There is also the sensory appeal factor. We’re engaged by and more likely to recall things that appeal to multiple senses. Given the constraints of a digital context, it’s hard to engage multiple senses, but with the iLike Challenge, you have the artist’s visuals, the motion of a timer count ing down, the audio input, and the interaction required by a game.
> 
> ...
> 
> _It wasn’t a focus on usability that made this a great experience. It was psychology._
> 
> Usability clears the way for a good experience by eliminating troublesome interface distractions, but a great experience stems from something more—an awareness of why people could or do care. The danger is in confusing “ease of use” with actually desiring to use something. ... To be clear, if a business approached me tomorrow about making their time-tracking tool fun to use, I’d start by making sure it was first easy to use. Adding “playful” elements on top of a frustrating experience will only complicate things. ... However, I’ve seen cases where the motivation to do something outweighed the usability challenges—the pull outweighed the friction.

## Chapter 4. Are you Attractive?

> _Emotion is not a luxury: it is an expression of basic mechanisms of life regulation developed in evolution, and is indispensable for survival. It plays a critical role in virtually all aspects of learning, reasoning, and creativity. Somewhat surprisingly, it may play a role in the construction of consciousness._
> 
> ...
> 
> Similarly, the user interface design decisions we make affect the perceived personality of our applications.
> 
> ...
> 
> Products have a personality. Why should we care? Consider this:
>
> - People identify with (or avoid) certain personalities.
> - Trust is related to personality.
> - Perception and expectations are linked with personality.
> - Consumers choose products that are an extension of themselves.
> - We treat sufficiently advanced technology as though it were human.

## Chapter 8. Are you Fun to be Around?

> That said, these are good arguments for the careful use of humor. But these are not reasons to avoid adding humor to our interactions. sure, if there are doubts, it’s much easier to avoid taking the risk of humor. however, you also risk publishing content that fails to engage people in a meaningful or memorable way. Adding a bit of humor will not only make you interaction more human, it can also add levity to an otherwise stressful situation, leading to any number of beneficial physiological effects (more on this in a moment).
>
> ...
> 
> One of the things I love about MailChimp is how you engage people emotionally in little ways, across different interactions. Did the company begin with the idea of making e-mail management fun, or was this a change along the way?
> 
> The humor and personality of MailChimp is really just a natural channeling of who we are as a company. People don’t want to interact with a corporate edifice if they don’t have to. We’ve found that by letting our personality shine through in the application we can make mundane work feel kind of fun. The emotional engagement we layer into the app is designed to enhance the experience, and never impede the workflow. The little jokes that Freddie, our chimp mascot, cracks at the top of a page set a tone for the relationship people have with the app.
> 
> ...
> 
> Our emotional design techniques employ a common psychology concept called priming. Each emotional design interaction point shapes a user’s perception of the MailChimp brand, and, if well executed, slowly builds good will and trust. The limbic system in our brains handles both emotion and long-term memory so we can easily recall things that are good for us or bad for us. By employing emotional design in our app, we’re consciously shaping positive memories of our brand that not only encourage users to stick around, but also turn them into evangelists for a product they love.
> 
> ...
> 
> When we’re anxious, the neural transmitter _norepinephrine_ is released into
the brain. norepinephrine is the brain equivalent of adrenaline, and it creates a rush of fear or anxiety. during these anxious moments we are more alert and focused. in situations where focus is needed, such as editing a paper for grammatical errors, a bit of anxiety-induced norepinephrine might be just the right thing.

## Chapter 10. Are you Stimulating?

> ![Landscape of Stimulating Users](/.attachments/stimulations.png)
> 
> ...
> 
> What information can you display in a way that arouses curiosity and encourages pattern-seeking behavior?

## Chapter 11. Are you Mysterious?

> Great storytellers know how to turn an ordinary event—say, a trip to the grocer—into a suspenseful one by withholding information. In new relationships, flirtation often involves some element of playful teasing, whether through conversation or more sensual revelations. and newsrooms have made a science out of crafting irresistible headlines: “Your PC might be infected!” or “are you prepared for the tax law changes?”
> 
> We are captivated by unanswered questions.
> 
> ....
> 
> With two or three dozen hot Wheels to choose from, guess which one the kids go for? In my experience, the one that gets attention (and allowances) is the mystery car—the one that is unknown.
> 
> Crazy? Perhaps it is. But this exact same bit of psychology also works on grown-ups.
> 
> ...
> 
> When we become aware that information is missing—when something changes from being known (or so we thought) to an unknown state—we become curious. This is the explanation of curiosity posed by behavioral economist George Loewenstein in his information gap theory. Loewenstein says, “Curiosity happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge.”
> 
> ...
> 
> ![Zone of Curiosity](/.attachments/zone.of.curiosity.png)
> 
> ...
> 
> Simply stated: I’m curious because there’s a gap between “what I know and what I want to know.” two notable implications come from this perspective:
> 
> - The _intensity_ of curiosity correlates to the likelihood of certain information to resolve the information gap. Loewenstein’s own tests confirmed that subjects were more curious when given parts of a greater whole—the need to complete enough of a picture puzzle to determine what it was (a picture of an animal) resulted in more interaction than a scenario where each block was a discrete picture.
> 
> - Curiosity correlates with our own understanding of a particular domain. The more we know about some topic, the more likely we are to focus on our own information gaps. If I know eight of ten items, I’m more curious about the remaining two than if I only know two of ten things.
> 
> ...
> 
> LinkedIn gives you a _personalized_ glimpse of what could be known, essentially teasing you with relevant information such as, “Someone at [company name] viewed your profile.” The site moves you into an unknown state by sharing bits of knowledge that can only be fully known as a paid member. Nothing has been given away for free—I still don’t know who looked at my profile, but I’m aware of some partial knowledge that might be worthwhile to know in full (see the top screen on the following page). As one friend said, “If someone from apple has been looking at my profile, you can bet I want to know who!”
> 
> If this partial information proves relevant and valuable, you’ll want to know more, right? In essence, they’ve created a “zone of curiosity” between two previously known states.
> 
> ...
> 
> If you want to make someone curious, make them aware of something they don’t know. Find information you can use to tease people. Chances are, you’re either withholding all the specific information or giving it all away. To get attention and engage the senses, look for ways to turn these direct messages into a quest. A few tips:
> - Make your tease interesting, or at least proportionate in appeal to the cost.
> - Strive to make the information personally relevant to the user.
> - Offer the promise of something worthwhile—what will it cost?
> - Establish trust through previous experiences and context clues.
> - Use visuals to suggest or create the immediate perception of mystery.
> - Don’t try to lure users with something that is given away freely elsewhere.

## Chapter 12. Can People Express Themselves Around You?

> The need for self-expression shows up in just about any area where people are allowed to control something, especially where this control is tied to an identity. The most obvious place for this is games, especially ones where the player has an avatar to dress and decorate. (It’s interesting to note that these avatars are most often idealized versions of the person in real life.) While the game Farmville doesn’t have avatars to customize, the player’s farm becomes an artistic canvas. Most players start off by simply thinking about an organized way to plant crops; more ambitious players use their farms to create some rather interesting works of art.

## Chapter 13. Small First Steps

> Whenever you can put something into simpler terms, you increase the odds that people will actually do that thing. Suggest a particular course of action, nudge people to take a first step, set up defaults, get a small initial commitment—these are the kinds of little details that can shape the path and change behavior.
> 
> ...
> 
> Closely related to the endowed progress effect is a principle called _sequencing_—if you want to motivate people to do something, break the task down into small steps.
> 
> ...
> 
> In most of my personal and professional interactions, I’ve stopped making big requests of people. My e-mails are direct and to the point, and I clearly state the next intended action. I’ve also stopped making multiple requests in a single e-mail, unless they are all closely related. Based on what I’ve learned about attention spans, interest, and motivation, if getting people to actually do something is the goal, you have to make the process as simple as possible!

## Chapter 14. Coming on Too Strong

> Does limiting the number of available choices make a difference? Numerous researchers have found that when presented with more options, we’re far less likely to take any action at all.
> 
> ...
> 
> _If every additional form field lowered response rates by 10 percent, what would you cut?_

## Chapter 16. The Path of Least Resistance

> Given two choices, we tend to choose the one that doesn’t require anything of us.
> 
> ...
> 
> We’ve talked about sticking with defaults, or continuing with what we already do. But why do we have a status-quo bias? Why do we prefer to leave things as they are?
>
> There are the obvious candidates: Fear of the unknown. Laziness. Safety (“hey, this seems to be what most people choose”). A sense of identity. Habit.
> 
> One of the more interesting findings about our inertia has to do with ownership bias and loss aversion. We hate to lose stuff. Even if there is more to be had, we hate letting go of what we already have. This can be seen with investors who hold on to stocks long after they should (rationally) have let them go. (Loss aversion explains this “sunk cost” effect.) But, personal investment is not required for us to develop an attachment to something. Consider some studies conducted by Amos tversky and Daniel Kahneman.

## Chapter 17. The Influence of Words

> _the way in which issues and data are stated can alter our judgment and affect decisions_
> 
> ...
> 
> This leads us to another rather curious mind hack, one exploited by salespeople, magicians, and others: _anchoring_. When making decisions, we rely too heavily—or anchor—on one trait or piece of information. This is because most of our judgments are not _absolute_ (based on all available information in the world), but rather _relative_, typically to the initial anchor being set.

> ***“Never underestimate the power of using ‘you’ in your writing!”***
> 
> Why does sierra advocate an informal, conversational writing style? Because this is what the brain looks for to see if it should be engaged. We may think we want to pay attention to a lecture, but when the speaker (or writer) speaks directly to “you,” the brain thinks we are now engaged in a conversation.
>

> 
> In 2009, blogger dustin Curtis, curious about the effects of forceful language, ran a little experiment. At the bottom of his web site, he has a call to action that invites people to follow him on twitter. He wanted to see if he could “increase the clickthrough rate even more by altering the way [this phrase] was worded.”
> 
> He began with a statement: “I’m on Twitter,” and found that this produced a 4.70 percent clickthrough rate.
> 
> Then he switched to a command: “Follow me on Twitter,” which produced a 7.31 percent clickthrough rate.
> 
> Then he tried a stronger personal command: “You should follow me on Twitter,” which produced a 10.09 percent clickthrough rate.
> 
> Finally, he added the literal callout “here,” for a final phrase of “You should follow me on Twitter here.” The result was a remarkable 12.81 percent clickthrough rate.

## Chapter 19. Real World Games

> Given the sustained interest that people give to a good game, it should come as no surprise that businesses have begun looking to gaming as a way to create customer loyalty or build interest in their service. This trend of adding things like points and badges to make sites more gamelike is widespread.
> 
> ...
> 
> What are the common characteristics shared by most games?
> 
> ...
> 
> I’ve found that most items tend to fit into one of these categories:
> 
> - Play & Challenges
> 
> - Conflicts & Choices
> 
> - Feedback Loops
> 
> - Goals & rewards
> 
> - Imaginary World
>
> ...
> 
> ![Classifying Motivators](/.attachments/elements.of.game.design.png)
> 
> ...
> 
> At their core, games are about play. But, what makes them games is the introduction of a challenge (or a series of small extrinsic challenges presented in the form of goals). Win the most points. Stay alive. Solve the riddle. Avoid being tagged.
>
> Succeeding at this challenge is complicated by artificial conflicts and choices. These are imposed by a set of rules that all players (or the player) agree to. Conflicts may come in the form of scarce resources, competition, or choices and calculations we have to make during the course of the game. Other players may help or hamper our efforts.
>
> Along the way, there will be all kinds of _feedback loops_ to let us know how we’re doing. These can be in real time or at periodic intervals. That strategy didn’t work so well. I wonder what will happen if I pair these cards? Dang, I lost a life.
> 
> Sometimes these feedback loops lead to or come in the form of extrinsic motivators such as _goals_ and _rewards_. get to the next level. Earn a badge. try this path next.
> 
> Finally, all of this takes place in an _imaginary world_ that we choose to enter.

## Chapter 20. A Challenge Worth Pursuing

> ***(Play + Challenges) + (Rewards + Goals) = Game***
> 
> The problem with many of the current attempts to “gamify” real life and business applications is that the formula above has been replaced with something more like this:
> 
> ***~(Play + Challenges)~ + (Rewards + Goals) = Game***
> 
> But rewards and goals (without challenges and play) do not make something a game. Or at least not one that’s very fun to play.
> 
> ...
> 
> For example, the social game **FarmVille** works because of three things:
> 
> - _Appointment mechanic_—you must return at an appointed time to harvest your crop
> 
> - _Self-expression_—you decide how to plant your garden
> 
> - _Social gifting_—you get ahead in the game by inviting more players.
> 
> Or, take pictionary. What makes it a fun game?
> 
> - _Limited duration_—60 seconds to guess what’s being drawn
> 
> - _Group competition_—groups compete against each other
> 
> - _Teamwork_—you must work together (in your team) to win the game
> 
> - _Self-expression_—whoever’s turn it is must decide how to render their image
> 
> - _Pattern recognition_—the team must guess what’s being drawn
>

> _Flow results when the challenge is equal to your ability; If something is too easy, boredom results. Too challenging, and people become overwhelmed._

## Chapter 21. Making Things Difficult

> By limiting noms, foodspotting encourages people to be more selective about which foods deserve special recognition. The site claims, “The blue ribbon (the ‘nom’) means more because it’s hard to get.” People won’t give every dish a nomination lest they have no remaining noms to give to a dish that really is exceptional.
> 
> Dribbble’s founders don’t hide their use of scarcity to encourage high quality submissions:
> 
> _“In case it isn’t obvious, the reason we throttle shots is to encourage players to post with care—we hope scarcity induces quality. (So far, so good.) We’ll be introducing other ways to accrue shots for meritorious behavior, but we want everyone to know that you’ll always have a base of 24 shots to work with each month.”_
> 
> ...
> 
> There’s another twist on scarcity, one that may seem contrary to everything stated so far. This twist is one of creating artificial limits—specifically, character limits. By enforcing a scarcity of characters, you can actually encourage participation. (This is different from creating desire as with the examples above.) Twitter is the perfect example of this.
> 
> The technical limits of mobile text messaging were the original constraint behind Twitter’s 140-character limit. But it is precisely this character limit that has driven a new form of written expression.
> 
> ...
> 
> One explanation of why scarcity works so well on us has to with decision making. it’s easier to go along with the crowd and buy the thing that is scarce. Why? according to persuasion expert robert cialdini in his 1998 book _Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion_, things “that are difficult to possess are typically better than those that are easy to possess.” People use this defining attribute—_limited availability_—to aid in their decision-making processes.
> 
> ...
> 
> The ultimate effect of all these constraints is that people are forced to make choices:
>
> _Do I do this now, or later?_
>
> _How should I go about doing this task?_
>
> _Who should I involve?_
>
> _What should I focus on first?_
> 
> In fact, much of the tension in games comes from setting up opposition between your long-term and short-term goals. for example, the big goal in Donkey Kong might be to save the princess. However, you’re presented with a short-term goal: go after the mushroom. This will give you more strength and points, but also puts your life in jeopardy. This immediate reward may jeopardize your success at the larger goal. Do you put yourself at risk? Or play it safe and focus only on the long-term goal?
> 
> Obviously, most of the software apps and Web sites we use haven’t yet reached this level of sophistication or emotional involvement. The field of behavioral economics has studied the factors that affect a decision. Game designers have explored ways to present players with different challenges.

## Chapter 22. How are We Doing?

> Far too often, we have interesting data, but it’s not displayed in a way that is compelling. in this discussion of numbers and data, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that we are emotional beings; there’s a growing body of research exploring how our affect (emotion) governs everything from decision making to memory. Make the time to look at what you are revealing and determine if there is a more compelling or emotional way to present that information.
> 
> ...
> 
> Competing with yourself is a very powerful motivator—if you provide something to compete against. This can be a best winning streak, a top score, the allure of the next level of mastery—the possibilities are endless.
> 
> ...
> 
> While competing against your own best score is a powerful motivator, social cues are much more powerful: How do i compare to my peers?
> 
> ...
> 
> I was designing a Web site for a client with a strong background in radio. they had been quite successful with their incentives programs for radio and assumed the same would apply to motivating user behaviors online. They proposed awarding points for things like commenting on a blog post or liking something.
> 
> This is dangerous territory and likely to yield less than stellar results. We know from various studies that what drives online behavior is not economic capital, but social capital.
> 
> The reasons people comment, share, like, and do all manner of social actions has to do with status, identity, reputation, and a host of other naturally occurring, intrinsic motivators. things like open source software and Wikipedia exist because of people’s intrinsic motivation. Mixing in external rewards and incentives is a surefire way to smother this passion or lead to unwanted results. As you read earlier, “rewards motivate people for more rewards.” If every comment is suddenly worth a few extra loyalty points, you really don’t care about the content of your comments anymore—you can start writing garbage and lots of it because you’re focused on the points (especially if they’re redeemable).
> 
> Yes, incentives work, but for very specific types of behavior.

## Chapter 23. What's the Prize?

> Over time, exciters become performance needs, and then basic needs. This explains why receiving a dozen roses isn’t quite as exciting as it was the last time, or the time before that. If you bring home flowers every tuesday, this will quickly become a basic expectation, no longer thrilling and missed only when you forget.
>

> Delight isn’t enough on it’s own—you also have to satisfy basic and (sometimes) performance needs. but, fail to also delight your customers and you leave yourself vulnerable to someone else who will make your customers swoon.
