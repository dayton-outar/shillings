## Chapter 5. The Game Consists of Elements

> There are many ways to break down and classify the many elements that form a game. Let’s look briefly at each of the four and how they relate to the others:
>
> 1. **Mechanics**: These are the procedures and rules of your game. Mechanics describe the goal of your game, how players can and cannot try to achieve it, and what happens when they try. If you compare games to more linear entertainment experiences (books, movies, etc.), you will note that while linear experiences involve technology, story, and aesthetics, they do not involve mechanics, for it is mechanics that make a game a game. When you choose a set of mechanics as crucial to your gameplay, you will need to choose technology that can support them, aesthetics that emphasize them clearly to players, and a story that allows your (sometimes strange) game mechanics to make sense to the players.
>
> 2. **Story**: This is the sequence of events that unfolds in your game. It may be linear and pre-scripted, or it may be branching and emergent. When you have a story you want to tell through your game, you have to choose the mechanics that will both strengthen that story and let that story emerge. Like any storyteller, you will want to choose the aesthetics that help reinforce the ideas of your story and the technology that is best suited to the particular story that will come out of your game.
>
> 3. **Aesthetics**: This is how your game looks, sounds, smells, tastes, and feels. Aesthetics are an incredibly important aspect of game design since they have the most direct relationship to a player’s experience. When you have a certain look, or tone, that you want players to experience and become immersed in, you will need to choose a technology that will not only allow the aesthetics to come through but amplify and reinforce them. You will want to choose the mechanics that make players feel like they are in the world that the aesthetics have defined, and you will want a story with a set of events that let your aesthetics emerge at the right pace and have the most impact.
>
> 4. **Technology**: We are not exclusively referring to “high technology” here, but to any materials and interactions that make your game possible such as paper and pencil, plastic chits, or high-powered lasers. The technology you choose for your game enables it to do certain things and prohibits it from doing other things. The technology is essentially the medium in which the aesthetics take place, in which the mechanics will occur, and through which the story will be told.

I can understand the story that chess is telling but what story is checkers telling; what story is Jamaican dominoes telling; what story is Candy Crush telling.

## Chapter 6. The Elements Support a Theme

> Sounds easy, but what is a theme? The theme is what your game is about. It is the idea that ties your entire game together—the idea that all the elements must support. If you don’t know what your theme is, it is very likely that your game is not engaging people as much as it could. Most game themes are experience based; that is, the goal of the design is to deliver an essential experience to the player.
>
> ...
>
> A unifying theme is good—it focuses your design toward a single goal. But some themes are better than others. The best themes are ones that resonate with ­players—themes that touch players deeply.
> 
> ...
> 
> When you manage to tap into one of these resonant themes, you have something deep and powerful that has a true ability to move people and to give them an experience that is both transcendent and transforming.
>
> ...
> 
> And it is certainly true that the players cannot always state clearly the theme of a work that truly moves them—and that is because theme often operates at a subconscious level. Players know they like a game, but they can’t quite say why. Often, the reason is that all of the elements are reinforcing a theme that is interesting or important to them. Theme is not about some puzzle-based symbolism where the designer intends a secret message. Theme is about focusing your work toward something that holds meaning for your players.

## Chapter 7. The Game Begins with an Idea

> The purpose of design is to solve problems, and game design is no exception. Before you start coming up with ideas, you need to be certain of why you are doing it, and a problem statement is a way to state that clearly.
> 
> ...
> 
> There are three advantages of clearly stating your problem:
> 
> 1. Broader creative space. Most people jump to solutions too fast and start their creative process there. If you start your process at the problem instead of at a proposed solution, you will be able to explore a broader creative space and find solutions that are hiding where no one else is looking.
> 
> 2. Clear measurement. You have a clear measurement of the quality of proposed ideas: How well do they solve the problem?
> 
> 3. Better communication. When you are designing with a team, communication is much easier if the problem has been clearly stated. Very often, collaborators will be trying to solve quite different problems and not realize it if the problem has not been clearly stated.

## Chapter 8. The Game Improves through Iteration

> Some people are quite disconcerted by this combination of snap decisions combined with sudden reversals. But it is the most efficient way to make full use of your decision-making power, and game design is all about making decisions—you need to make the best decisions possible, as fast as possible, and this slightly eccentric behavior is the way to do it. It’s always better to commit to an idea sooner, rather than later—you will get to a good decision much faster than if you bide your time considering potential alternatives. Just don’t fall in love with your decision and be ready to reverse it the moment it isn’t working for you.

## Chapter 9. The Game Is Made for a Player

> At one point in his career, Albert Einstein was asked by a small local organization to be the guest of honor at a luncheon and to give a lecture about his research. He agreed to do so. The luncheon was quite pleasant, and when the time came, the host anxiously announced that Albert Einstein, the famous scientist, was there to talk about his theories of special and general relativity. Einstein took the stage, and looking out a largely nonacademic audience consisting of mostly old ladies, he explained to them that he certainly could talk about his work, but it was a bit dull, and he was thinking perhaps instead the audience would prefer to hear him play the violin. The host and audience both agreed that it sounded like a fine idea. Einstein proceeded to play several pieces he knew well, creating a delightful experience the entire audience was able to enjoy and surely one they remembered for the rest of their lives.
>
> Einstein was able to create such a memorable experience because he knew his audience.
> 
> ...
> 
> As with everything else in game design, the key here is a kind of listening. You must learn to listen to your players, thoroughly and deeply.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Bartle’s Taxonomy of Player Types**
>
> 1. **♦ Achievers** want to achieve the goals of the game. Their primary pleasure is challenge.
> 
> 2. **♠ Explorers** want to get to know the breadth of the game. Their primary pleasure is discovery.
> 
> 3. **♥ Socializers** are interested in relationships with other people. They primarily seek the pleasures of fellowship.
> 
> 4. **♣ Killers** are interested in competing with and defeating others. This category does not map well to LeBlanc’s taxonomy. For the most part, it seems killers enjoy a mix of the pleasures of competition and destruction. Interestingly, Bartle characterizes them as primarily interested in “imposing themselves on others” and includes in this category people who are primarily interested in helping others.
> 
> Bartle also proposes a fascinating graph (Figure 9.4) that shows how the four types neatly cover a sort of space: that is, achievers are interested in acting on the world, explorers are interested in interacting with the world, socializers are interested in interacting with players, and killers are interested in acting on players.
> 
> ![Bartle Taxonomy Matrix](/.attachments/bartle.matrix.png)
> 
> **More Pleasure: MORE!**
>
> We must use caution when trying to make such simple taxonomies to describe something as complex as human desire. Under close scrutiny, both LeBlanc’s and Bartle’s taxonomies (and other similar lists) have gaps and when misused can gloss over subtle pleasures that might easily be missed, such as “destruction” and “nurturing,” which we encountered in our discussion of gender stereotypes. The following is a list of a few more pleasures to be considered:
>
> - **Anticipation**: When you know a pleasure is coming, just waiting for it is a kind of pleasure.
> 
> - **Completion**: It feels good to finish something. Many games take advantage of the pleasure of completion—any game where you have to “collect all the treasures,” “destroy all the bad guys,” or otherwise “clear the level” is taking advantage of this pleasure.
> 
> - **Delight in another’s misfortune**: Typically, we feel this when some unjust ­person suddenly gets their comeuppance. It is an important aspect of ­competitive games. The Germans call it schadenfreude (pronounced “shoddenfroyduh”).
> 
> - **Gift giving**: There is a unique pleasure when you make someone else happy through the surprise of a gift. We wrap our presents to heighten and intensify this surprise. The pleasure is not just that the person is happy but that you made them happy.
> 
> - **Humor**: Two unconnected things are suddenly united by a paradigm shift. It is hard to describe, but we all know it when it happens. Weirdly, it causes us to make a barking noise.
>
> - **Possibility**: This is the pleasure of having many choices and knowing you could pick any one of them. This is often experienced when shopping or at a buffet table.
> 
> - **Pride in an accomplishment**: This is a pleasure all its own that can persist long after the accomplishment was made. The Yiddish word naches (pronounced “nock-hess”) is about this kind of pleased satisfaction, usually referring to pride in children or grandchildren.
>
> - **Surprise**: The brain likes surprises.
> 
> - **Thrill**: There is a saying among roller coaster designers that “fear minus death equals fun.”Thrill is that kind of fun—you experience terror but feel secure in your safety.
> 
> - **Triumph over adversity**: This is that pleasure that you have accomplished something that you knew was a long shot. Typically, this pleasure is accompanied by shouts of personal triumph. The Italians have a word for this pleasure: fiero (pronounced fee-air-o).
> 
> - **Wonder**: An overwhelming feeling of awe and amazement. It almost always leads to a feeling of curiosity, which is how “wonder” gets its name.
>
> And there are many, many more. I list these pleasures that fall outside of easy classification to illustrate the richness of the pleasure space. Lists of pleasures can serve as convenient rules of thumb, but don’t forget to keep an open mind for ones that might not be on your list. Also keep in mind that pleasure is very context-sensitive. What might be very pleasurable in one context (dancing at a party) might be torturously embarrassing in another context (dancing at a job interview).

## Chapter 10. The Experience is in the Player's Mind

> The following are some of the key components necessary to create an activity that puts a player into a flow state:
> 
> - **Clear goals**: When our goals are clear, we are able to more easily stay focused on our task. When goals are unclear, we are not “into” our task, for we aren’t at all certain whether our current actions are useful.
> 
> - **No distractions**: Distractions steal focus from our task. No focus, no flow. This means engaging both mind and hands. Menial labor with no thought makes the mind wander; just sitting and thinking can make the hands fidget. These “itchy” feelings are each a kind of distraction.
> 
> - **Direct feedback**: If every time we take an action, we have to wait before we know what effect the action caused, we will quickly become distracted and lose focus on our task. When feedback is immediate, we can easily stay focused.
> 
> - **Continuously challenging**: Human beings love a challenge. But it must be a challenge we think we can achieve. If we start to think we can’t achieve it, we feel frustrated, and our minds start seeking an activity more likely to be rewarding. On the other hand, if the challenge is too easy, we feel bored, and again, our minds start seeking more rewarding activities.
> 
> Flow activities must manage to stay in the narrow margin of challenge that lies between boredom and frustration, for both of these unpleasant extremes cause our mind to change its focus to a new activity.

## Chapter 11. The Player's Mind is Driven by the Player's Motivation

> Surprisingly, Ryan and Deci suggest that we have precisely three mental needs:
> 
> 1. **Competence**: I need to feel good at something.
>
> 2. **Autonomy**: I need freedom to do things my own way.
>
> 3. **Relatedness**: I need to connect with other people.
>
> ...
> 
> For an interesting perspective on the motivations in your game, try putting each one on a matrix, where one axis is internal/external and the other is have-to/want-to. It is one more illustration of how richly complex and interesting human motivation can be.
> 
> ![Motivation Matrix](/.attachments/motivation.matrix-1.png)
> 
> ...
> 
> It is impossible to overestimate the importance of novelty as motivation in the realm of game design. Human beings are natural explorers, and we are always interested in that which is new.
> 
> ...
> 
> So do not despair at man’s insatiable appetite for novelty—instead, embrace it, and give the people what they want: something they have never experienced before.

## Chapter 12. Some Elements are Game Mechanics

> As with many things in game design, we do not have a universally ­agreed-upon taxonomy of game mechanics. One reason for this is that the mechanics of gameplay, even for simple games, tend to be quite complex and very difficult to ­disentangle. Attempts at simplifying these complex mechanics to the point of perfect ­mathematical understanding result in systems of description that are obviously incomplete. Economic “game theory” is an example of this. You would think with a name like “game theory,” it would be of great use to game designers, but in truth, it can only handle such simple systems that it is seldom useful for designing real games.
>
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 1: Space**
>
> Every game takes place in some kind of **space**. This space is the “magic circle” of gameplay. It defines the various places that can exist in a game and how those places are related to one another. As a game mechanic, space is a mathematical construct. We need to strip away all visuals, all aesthetics, and simply look at the abstract construction of a game’s space.
> 
> ...
> 
> At first glance, you might say it is a discrete 2D space, like a chessboard, with most of the middle cells missing. But it can be more simply represented as a 1D space—a single line of forty discrete points, which connects to itself in a loop. Sure, on the game board, the corner spaces look special because they are bigger, but ­functionally that doesn’t matter, since each game square is a zero-dimensional space. Multiple game pieces can be in a single game square, but their relative ­positions within that square are meaningless.
> 
> But not all game spaces are discrete. A pool table is an example of a continuous 2D space. It has a fixed length and width, and the balls can freely move about on the table, ricocheting off of the walls or falling into the holes, which are in fixed ­positions. Everyone would agree that the space is continuous, but is it 2D? Since clever players can sometimes cause the balls to leave the table and hop over each other, you could certainly argue that this is really a 3D game space, and for some purposes, it is useful to think of it that way. There are no hard and fast rules for these abstract functional spaces. When designing a new game, there are times it will be useful for you to think of your space as 2D and there are times when thinking of it as 3D is more useful. The same goes for continuous vs. discrete. The ­purpose of stripping down a game into a functional space is so that you can more easily think about it, without the distractions of aesthetics or the real world. If you are thinking about modifying the game of soccer to a playing field with new boundaries, you will probably think about it in terms of a 2D continuous space.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 2: Time**
> 
> In the real world, **time** is the most mysterious of dimensions. Against our will, we travel through it, ever forward, with no way to stop, turn around, slow down, or speed up. In the world of games, we often try to remedy this lack of control by creating toy worlds that let us play with time like gods.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 3: Objects**
> 
> A space without anything in it is, well, just a space. Your game space will surely have **objects** in it. Characters, props, tokens, scoreboards, or anything that can be seen or manipulated in your game falls into this category. Objects are the “nouns” of game mechanics. Technically, there are times you might consider the space itself an object, but usually the space of your game is different enough from other objects that it stands apart. Objects generally have one or more **attributes**, one of which is often the current position in the game space.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 4: Actions**
> 
> The next important game mechanic is the **action**. Actions are the “verbs” of game mechanics. There are two perspectives on actions or, put another way, two ways to answer the question “What can the players do?”
> 
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 5: Rules**
> 
> The **rules** are really the most fundamental mechanic. They define the space, the timing, the objects, the actions, the consequences of the actions, the constraints on the actions, and the goals. In other words, they make possible all the mechanics we have seen so far and add the crucial thing that makes a game a game—goals.
> 
> ...
> 
> Rules are the most fundamental of all game mechanics. A game is not just defined by its rules; a game is its rules.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 6: Skill**
> 
> The mechanic of **skill** shifts the focus away from the game and onto the player. Every game requires players to exercise certain skills. If the player’s skill level is a good match to the game’s difficulty, the player will feel challenged and stay in the flow channel.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 7: Chance**
> 
> Our seventh and final game mechanic is **chance**. We deal with it last because it concerns interactions between all of the other six mechanics: space, time, objects, actions, rules, and skills.
> 
> Chance is an essential part of a fun game because chance means uncertainty, and uncertainty means surprises.

## Chapter 13. Game Mechanics Must be in Balance

> To novice designers, the business of balancing a game seems quite ­mysterious—but really, balancing a game is nothing more than adjusting the elements of the game until they deliver the experience you want.
> 
> ...
> 
> **The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance**
> 
> ***Balance Type #1: Fairness***
>
> One quality that players universally seek in games is fairness. Players want to feel that the forces working against them do not have an advantage that will make them impossible to defeat. One of the simplest ways to ensure this is to make your game symmetrical, that is, to give equal resources and powers to all players. Most traditional board games (such as checkers, chess, and Monopoly) and almost all sports use this method to be sure that no player has an unfair advantage over another.
> 
> ...
> 
> One simple way to balance elements for fairness is to make sure that whenever something in your game has an advantage over something else, yet another thing has an advantage over that! Often referred to as “circular balance,” the iconic example of this is the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors where
>
> - Rock breaks scissors
> - Scissors cut paper
> - Paper covers rock
>
> None of the elements can be supreme, because there is always another that can defeat it. It is a simple way to ensure that every game element has both strengths and weaknesses. Fighting games particularly like to use this technique to help ensure none of the warriors a player might choose are undefeatable.
>
> ...
> 
> ***Balance Type #2: Challenge vs. Success***
> 
> If play is too challenging, the player becomes frustrated. But if the player succeeds too easily, they can become bored. Keeping the player on the middle path means keeping the experiences of challenge and success in proper balance. This can be particularly difficult since players may have all different levels of skill. What one player finds boring, another may find challenging, and yet another may find frustrating. Some common techniques for striking a proper balance include the following:
> 
> - _Increase difficulty with each success_: This is a very common pattern in videogames—each level is harder than the last. Players build their skill until they can complete a level, only to be presented with one that challenges them yet again.
> 
> - _Let players get through easy parts fast_: Assuming your game has some method of gradually increasing the difficulty, you do yourself a service by allowing skilled players to finish a level quickly if they can easily master it. This way, skilled players will blow through easy levels, quickly getting to a challenge that is more interesting to them, while less skilled players will be challenged by the early levels. This lets every player quickly get to the part of the game that is a challenge. If you arrange it differently, such that each level takes one hour to play, regardless of skill level, skilled players may quickly grow bored from lack of challenge.
> 
> - _Create “layers of challenge”_: A popular pattern in games is to give a grade, or some number of stars, at the end of each level or mission. If you get a “D” or “F,” you must repeat the level, but if you get a “C” or better, you can continue. This creates a situation with a lot of flexibility in how you can play it. Novice players are thrilled to get a “C” and unlock the next level. As they gain experience and have unlocked all the levels, they may set themselves a new challenge—to earn an “A” (or even “A+”!) on earlier levels.
> 
> - _Let players choose the difficulty level_: A tried and true method is to let players choose to play on “easy, medium, or hard” modes. Some games (e.g., many Atari 2600 games) even let you change the difficulty-level midgame. The upside of this is that players can quickly find the appropriate challenge level for their skill level. The downside is that you have to create and balance multiple versions of your game. Also, it can detract from the “reality” of your game—players will argue over which version is the “real” one or be left feeling unsure whether any of them are “real.”
> 
> - _Playtest with a variety of players_: Many designers fall into a trap of only testing with people who are constantly exposed to the game and end up designing a game that is too frustrating for novices. Others fall into the opposite trap and only test their game with people who have never played before. They end up designing a game that experienced players quickly grow bored with. Wise designers playtest with a mix of skilled and novice players, to be sure that their game is fun at first, fun after a while, and fun much, much later.
> 
> - _Give the losers a break_: _Mario Kart_ is famous for its unusual system of giving out power-ups. Players who are ahead in the race get meager power-ups, while players who are far behind get the good stuff, allowing them to race ahead. This is a great system for that game because it feels more fair and keeps everyone engaged: players who are behind need to pay attention because a game-­changing power-up could come at any second, and players who are ahead cannot afford to rest on their laurels because that “blue shell” could hit them at any time. This tricky system does a great job at nudging all players to the center of the flow channel.
> 
> ...
> 
> Many designers are so afraid of players beating their game too easily that they make later levels so fiendishly difficult to win that 90% of players eventually give up on the game in frustration. These designers hope that the increased challenge will extend the play time—and there is something to that—if you have expended forty hours to get through level nine, you will probably be willing to work pretty hard to defeat level ten. But in truth, there are so many competing games to play that many players just give up in frustration. On the other hand, with a free to play game, this late-game frustration might be just what you want, to spur players to pay money and move toward completion. As a designer, it makes sense to ask yourself, “What percentage of players do I want to be able to complete this game?” and then design for that.
>
> ...
> 
> ***Balance Type #3: Meaningful Choices***
> 
> There are many different ways to give a player choices in a game. Meaningful choices for a player lead them to ask themselves questions, such as the following:
> 
> - Where should I go?
> 
> - How should I spend my resources?
> 
> - What should I practice and try to perfect?
> 
> - How should I dress my character?
> 
> - Should I try to get through the game quickly or carefully?
> 
> - Should I focus on offense or defense?
> 
> - What strategy should I use in this situation?
> 
> - Which power should I choose?
> 
> - Should I play it safe or take a big risk?
> 
> A good game gives the player meaningful choices. Not just any choices but choices that will have a real impact on what happens next and how the game turns out. Many designers fall into the trap of offering the player meaningless choices; for example, in a racing game, you might have 50 vehicles to choose from, but if they all drive the same way, it is like having no choice at all. Other designers fall into a different trap—offering choices that no one would want. You might offer a soldier ten guns, all different, but if one of them is clearly better than the rest, again it is like having no choice at all.
> 
> When choices are offered to a player, but one of them is clearly better than the rest, this is called a **dominant strategy**. Once a dominant strategy is discovered, the game is no longer fun, because the puzzle of the game has been solved—there are no more choices to make. When you discover that a game you are working on has a dominant strategy, you must change the rules (balance things) so that this strategy no longer dominates and meaningful choice can be restored to the game.
> 
> Michael Mateas points out that the number of choices a player seeks is dependent on the number of things they desire:
>
> - If choices > desires, then the player is overwhelmed.
> - If choices < desires, the player is frustrated.
> - If choices = desires, the player has a feeling of freedom and fulfillment.
>
> So, to properly determine the number of choices, you need to figure out the types and number of things the player would like to do.
> 
> ...
> 
> One of the most exciting and interesting choices for a player to make is whether to play it safe and go for a small reward or take a big risk to try for a big reward. This is a hard decision to make, if the game is balanced properly. I find that about eight out of ten times someone comes to me asking for help on a game prototype that “just isn’t fun”; the game is missing this kind of meaningful choice. You could call this “balanced asymmetric risk,” since you are balancing a low risk with low reward against a high risk for high reward, but that is kind of a mouthful. This relationship comes up so often, and is so important, that I like to give it a shorter name: **triangularity**. The player is one point of the triangle, the low-risk choice is the second point, and the high-risk choice
is the third.
> 
> ... Without the flying saucer, Space Invaders gets quite tedious, because your choices are few—you just shoot and shoot and shoot. With the flying saucer, you occasionally have a ery difficult, meaningful choice to make—should you play it safe or take a risk and go for the big points?
> 
> ...
> 
> A classic example of triangularity appears in the book _Hackers_ by Steven Levy. An MIT engineer hacked a vending machine giving each user a choice: get your snack from the vending machine for normal price as usual or take a chance. A digital coin could be flipped, resulting in your snack either costing double or being completely free.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Balancing Type #4: Skill vs. Chance***
> 
> ... Too much chance negates the effects of player skill and vice versa. There is no easy answer for this one—some players prefer games with as few elements of chance as possible, and other players prefer the opposite. Games of skill tend to be more like athletic contests—systems of judgment that determine which player is the best. Games of chance often have a more relaxed, casual nature—after all, much of the outcome is up to fate.
> 
> One very common method of balancing these is to alternate the use of chance and skill in a game. For example, dealing out a hand of cards is pure chance—but choosing how to play them is pure skill. Rolling a die to see how far you move is pure chance—deciding where to move your piece is pure skill. This can create an alternating pattern of tension and relaxation that can be very pleasing to players.
> 
> Designer David Perry advises that the key to addictive game design is designing your game such that players are doing three things at all times: exercising a skill, taking risks, and working a strategy. And it is certainly true that any time players are taking risks, they are up against chance, in some way.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Balancing Type #5: Head vs. Hands***
> 
> This type of balancing is quite straightforward: how much of the game should involve doing a challenging physical activity (be it steering, throwing, or pushing buttons dexterously), and how much of it should involve thinking? These two things are not as separate as they might seem on the surface—many games involve constant strategizing and puzzle solving while simultaneously pulling off feats of speed and dexterity.
> 
> ...
> 
> It is important, though, to understand what your target market prefers in a game—more thinking or more dexterity? And it is equally important that your game clearly communicate what balance you have chosen to put into it.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Balance Type #6: Competition vs. Cooperation***
> 
> Competition and cooperation are basic, animal urges. All higher animals are driven to compete against others partly for survival and partly to establish their status in the community. Opposite of that, there is also a basic instinct to cooperate with others, since a team, with its many eyes and hands and its diverse abilities, is always more powerful than an individual. Competition and cooperation are so important to our survival that we need to experiment with them—partly to get better at them and partly to learn about our friends and family—so we get a better sense of who is good at what and how we can work together. Games provide a very socially safe way to explore how the people around us behave in stressful situations—this is a secret reason we like to play games together.
> 
> Some games find interesting ways to blend competition and cooperation. The arcade game Joust can be played solo, where a player competes against many ­computer-controlled enemies, or it can be played in a two-player mode, where both players compete against enemies together in the same arena. There is a tension between competition and cooperation in Joust that is very interesting: On the competitive side, the players get points based on how many enemies they defeat, and they can battle each other if they choose. But on the cooperative side, players can get higher scores overall if they coordinate their attacks and protect each other.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Balance Type #7: Short vs. Long***
> 
> One important thing to balance in every game is the length of the gameplay. If the game is too short, players may not get a chance to develop and execute meaningful strategies. But if the game goes on too long, players may grow bored, or they may avoid the game because playing it requires too much of a time commitment.
> 
> ...
> 
> The main factors that determine when a game ends are the win or lose conditions. By altering these conditions, you can dramatically change the length of the game. The designers of the arcade game Spy Hunter came up with a very interesting system to balance the length of their game. In Spy Hunter, you drive a car that fires machine guns at enemies on a highway. In early prototypes, when your car was destroyed three times, the game was over. The game is very challenging, particularly for novice players, and the designers found that these players were having very short games and feeling frustrated—so they introduced a new rule: For the first ninety seconds of gameplay, the player has an unlimited supply of cars—they cannot lose the game during this time. After that time is up, they only have a few cars, and when they are destroyed, the game is over.
> 
> ***Balance Type #8: Rewards***
