## Chapter 5. The Game Consists of Elements

> There are many ways to break down and classify the many elements that form a game. Let’s look briefly at each of the four and how they relate to the others:
>
> 1. **Mechanics**: These are the procedures and rules of your game. Mechanics describe the goal of your game, how players can and cannot try to achieve it, and what happens when they try. If you compare games to more linear entertainment experiences (books, movies, etc.), you will note that while linear experiences involve technology, story, and aesthetics, they do not involve mechanics, for it is mechanics that make a game a game. When you choose a set of mechanics as crucial to your gameplay, you will need to choose technology that can support them, aesthetics that emphasize them clearly to players, and a story that allows your (sometimes strange) game mechanics to make sense to the players.
>
> 2. **Story**: This is the sequence of events that unfolds in your game. It may be linear and pre-scripted, or it may be branching and emergent. When you have a story you want to tell through your game, you have to choose the mechanics that will both strengthen that story and let that story emerge. Like any storyteller, you will want to choose the aesthetics that help reinforce the ideas of your story and the technology that is best suited to the particular story that will come out of your game.
>
> 3. **Aesthetics**: This is how your game looks, sounds, smells, tastes, and feels. Aesthetics are an incredibly important aspect of game design since they have the most direct relationship to a player’s experience. When you have a certain look, or tone, that you want players to experience and become immersed in, you will need to choose a technology that will not only allow the aesthetics to come through but amplify and reinforce them. You will want to choose the mechanics that make players feel like they are in the world that the aesthetics have defined, and you will want a story with a set of events that let your aesthetics emerge at the right pace and have the most impact.
>
> 4. **Technology**: We are not exclusively referring to “high technology” here, but to any materials and interactions that make your game possible such as paper and pencil, plastic chits, or high-powered lasers. The technology you choose for your game enables it to do certain things and prohibits it from doing other things. The technology is essentially the medium in which the aesthetics take place, in which the mechanics will occur, and through which the story will be told.

I can understand the story that chess is telling but what story is checkers telling; what story is Jamaican dominoes telling; what story is Candy Crush telling.

## Chapter 6. The Elements Support a Theme

> Sounds easy, but what is a theme? The theme is what your game is about. It is the idea that ties your entire game together—the idea that all the elements must support. If you don’t know what your theme is, it is very likely that your game is not engaging people as much as it could. Most game themes are experience based; that is, the goal of the design is to deliver an essential experience to the player.
>
> ...
>
> A unifying theme is good—it focuses your design toward a single goal. But some themes are better than others. The best themes are ones that resonate with ­players—themes that touch players deeply.
> 
> ...
> 
> When you manage to tap into one of these resonant themes, you have something deep and powerful that has a true ability to move people and to give them an experience that is both transcendent and transforming.
>
> ...
> 
> And it is certainly true that the players cannot always state clearly the theme of a work that truly moves them—and that is because theme often operates at a subconscious level. Players know they like a game, but they can’t quite say why. Often, the reason is that all of the elements are reinforcing a theme that is interesting or important to them. Theme is not about some puzzle-based symbolism where the designer intends a secret message. Theme is about focusing your work toward something that holds meaning for your players.

## Chapter 7. The Game Begins with an Idea

> The purpose of design is to solve problems, and game design is no exception. Before you start coming up with ideas, you need to be certain of why you are doing it, and a problem statement is a way to state that clearly.
> 
> ...
> 
> There are three advantages of clearly stating your problem:
> 
> 1. Broader creative space. Most people jump to solutions too fast and start their creative process there. If you start your process at the problem instead of at a proposed solution, you will be able to explore a broader creative space and find solutions that are hiding where no one else is looking.
> 
> 2. Clear measurement. You have a clear measurement of the quality of proposed ideas: How well do they solve the problem?
> 
> 3. Better communication. When you are designing with a team, communication is much easier if the problem has been clearly stated. Very often, collaborators will be trying to solve quite different problems and not realize it if the problem has not been clearly stated.

## Chapter 8. The Game Improves through Iteration

> Some people are quite disconcerted by this combination of snap decisions combined with sudden reversals. But it is the most efficient way to make full use of your decision-making power, and game design is all about making decisions—you need to make the best decisions possible, as fast as possible, and this slightly eccentric behavior is the way to do it. It’s always better to commit to an idea sooner, rather than later—you will get to a good decision much faster than if you bide your time considering potential alternatives. Just don’t fall in love with your decision and be ready to reverse it the moment it isn’t working for you.

## Chapter 9. The Game Is Made for a Player

> At one point in his career, Albert Einstein was asked by a small local organization to be the guest of honor at a luncheon and to give a lecture about his research. He agreed to do so. The luncheon was quite pleasant, and when the time came, the host anxiously announced that Albert Einstein, the famous scientist, was there to talk about his theories of special and general relativity. Einstein took the stage, and looking out a largely nonacademic audience consisting of mostly old ladies, he explained to them that he certainly could talk about his work, but it was a bit dull, and he was thinking perhaps instead the audience would prefer to hear him play the violin. The host and audience both agreed that it sounded like a fine idea. Einstein proceeded to play several pieces he knew well, creating a delightful experience the entire audience was able to enjoy and surely one they remembered for the rest of their lives.

> Einstein was able to create such a memorable experience because he knew his audience.

> As with everything else in game design, the key here is a kind of listening. You must learn to listen to your players, thoroughly and deeply.

> **Bartle’s Taxonomy of Player Types**
>
> 1. **♦ Achievers** want to achieve the goals of the game. Their primary pleasure is challenge.
> 
> 2. **♠ Explorers** want to get to know the breadth of the game. Their primary pleasure is discovery.
> 
> 3. **♥ Socializers** are interested in relationships with other people. They primarily seek the pleasures of fellowship.
> 
> 4. **♣ Killers** are interested in competing with and defeating others. This category does not map well to LeBlanc’s taxonomy. For the most part, it seems killers enjoy a mix of the pleasures of competition and destruction. Interestingly, Bartle characterizes them as primarily interested in “imposing themselves on others” and includes in this category people who are primarily interested in helping others.
> 
> Bartle also proposes a fascinating graph (Figure 9.4) that shows how the four types neatly cover a sort of space: that is, achievers are interested in acting on the world, explorers are interested in interacting with the world, socializers are interested in interacting with players, and killers are interested in acting on players.

> 
> **More Pleasure: MORE!**
>
> We must use caution when trying to make such simple taxonomies to describe something as complex as human desire. Under close scrutiny, both LeBlanc’s and Bartle’s taxonomies (and other similar lists) have gaps and when misused can gloss over subtle pleasures that might easily be missed, such as “destruction” and “nurturing,” which we encountered in our discussion of gender stereotypes. The following is a list of a few more pleasures to be considered:
>
> - **Anticipation**: When you know a pleasure is coming, just waiting for it is a kind of pleasure.
> 
> - **Completion**: It feels good to finish something. Many games take advantage of the pleasure of completion—any game where you have to “collect all the treasures,” “destroy all the bad guys,” or otherwise “clear the level” is taking advantage of this pleasure.
> 
> - **Delight in another’s misfortune**: Typically, we feel this when some unjust ­person suddenly gets their comeuppance. It is an important aspect of ­competitive games. The Germans call it schadenfreude (pronounced “shoddenfroyduh”).
> 
> - **Gift giving**: There is a unique pleasure when you make someone else happy through the surprise of a gift. We wrap our presents to heighten and intensify this surprise. The pleasure is not just that the person is happy but that you made them happy.
> 
> - **Humor**: Two unconnected things are suddenly united by a paradigm shift. It is hard to describe, but we all know it when it happens. Weirdly, it causes us to make a barking noise.
>
> - **Possibility**: This is the pleasure of having many choices and knowing you could pick any one of them. This is often experienced when shopping or at a buffet table.
> 
> - **Pride in an accomplishment**: This is a pleasure all its own that can persist long after the accomplishment was made. The Yiddish word naches (pronounced “nock-hess”) is about this kind of pleased satisfaction, usually referring to pride in children or grandchildren.
>
> - **Surprise**: The brain likes surprises.
> 
> - **Thrill**: There is a saying among roller coaster designers that “fear minus death equals fun.”Thrill is that kind of fun—you experience terror but feel secure in your safety.
> 
> - **Triumph over adversity**: This is that pleasure that you have accomplished something that you knew was a long shot. Typically, this pleasure is accompanied by shouts of personal triumph. The Italians have a word for this pleasure: fiero (pronounced fee-air-o).
> 
> - **Wonder**: An overwhelming feeling of awe and amazement. It almost always leads to a feeling of curiosity, which is how “wonder” gets its name.
>
> And there are many, many more. I list these pleasures that fall outside of easy classification to illustrate the richness of the pleasure space. Lists of pleasures can serve as convenient rules of thumb, but don’t forget to keep an open mind for ones that might not be on your list. Also keep in mind that pleasure is very context-sensitive. What might be very pleasurable in one context (dancing at a party) might be torturously embarrassing in another context (dancing at a job interview).
