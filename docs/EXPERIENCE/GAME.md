## Chapter 5. The Game Consists of Elements

> There are many ways to break down and classify the many elements that form a game. Let’s look briefly at each of the four and how they relate to the others:
>
> 1. **Mechanics**: These are the procedures and rules of your game. Mechanics describe the goal of your game, how players can and cannot try to achieve it, and what happens when they try. If you compare games to more linear entertainment experiences (books, movies, etc.), you will note that while linear experiences involve technology, story, and aesthetics, they do not involve mechanics, for it is mechanics that make a game a game. When you choose a set of mechanics as crucial to your gameplay, you will need to choose technology that can support them, aesthetics that emphasize them clearly to players, and a story that allows your (sometimes strange) game mechanics to make sense to the players.
>
> 2. **Story**: This is the sequence of events that unfolds in your game. It may be linear and pre-scripted, or it may be branching and emergent. When you have a story you want to tell through your game, you have to choose the mechanics that will both strengthen that story and let that story emerge. Like any storyteller, you will want to choose the aesthetics that help reinforce the ideas of your story and the technology that is best suited to the particular story that will come out of your game.
>
> 3. **Aesthetics**: This is how your game looks, sounds, smells, tastes, and feels. Aesthetics are an incredibly important aspect of game design since they have the most direct relationship to a player’s experience. When you have a certain look, or tone, that you want players to experience and become immersed in, you will need to choose a technology that will not only allow the aesthetics to come through but amplify and reinforce them. You will want to choose the mechanics that make players feel like they are in the world that the aesthetics have defined, and you will want a story with a set of events that let your aesthetics emerge at the right pace and have the most impact.
>
> 4. **Technology**: We are not exclusively referring to “high technology” here, but to any materials and interactions that make your game possible such as paper and pencil, plastic chits, or high-powered lasers. The technology you choose for your game enables it to do certain things and prohibits it from doing other things. The technology is essentially the medium in which the aesthetics take place, in which the mechanics will occur, and through which the story will be told.

I can understand the story that chess is telling but what story is checkers telling; what story is Jamaican dominoes telling; what story is Candy Crush telling.

## Chapter 6. The Elements Support a Theme

> Sounds easy, but what is a theme? The theme is what your game is about. It is the idea that ties your entire game together—the idea that all the elements must support. If you don’t know what your theme is, it is very likely that your game is not engaging people as much as it could. Most game themes are experience based; that is, the goal of the design is to deliver an essential experience to the player.
>
> ...
>
> A unifying theme is good—it focuses your design toward a single goal. But some themes are better than others. The best themes are ones that resonate with ­players—themes that touch players deeply.
> 
> ...
> 
> When you manage to tap into one of these resonant themes, you have something deep and powerful that has a true ability to move people and to give them an experience that is both transcendent and transforming.
>
> ...
> 
> And it is certainly true that the players cannot always state clearly the theme of a work that truly moves them—and that is because theme often operates at a subconscious level. Players know they like a game, but they can’t quite say why. Often, the reason is that all of the elements are reinforcing a theme that is interesting or important to them. Theme is not about some puzzle-based symbolism where the designer intends a secret message. Theme is about focusing your work toward something that holds meaning for your players.

## Chapter 7. The Game Begins with an Idea

> The purpose of design is to solve problems, and game design is no exception. Before you start coming up with ideas, you need to be certain of why you are doing it, and a problem statement is a way to state that clearly.
> 
> ...
> 
> There are three advantages of clearly stating your problem:
> 
> 1. Broader creative space. Most people jump to solutions too fast and start their creative process there. If you start your process at the problem instead of at a proposed solution, you will be able to explore a broader creative space and find solutions that are hiding where no one else is looking.
> 
> 2. Clear measurement. You have a clear measurement of the quality of proposed ideas: How well do they solve the problem?
> 
> 3. Better communication. When you are designing with a team, communication is much easier if the problem has been clearly stated. Very often, collaborators will be trying to solve quite different problems and not realize it if the problem has not been clearly stated.

## Chapter 8. The Game Improves through Iteration

> Some people are quite disconcerted by this combination of snap decisions combined with sudden reversals. But it is the most efficient way to make full use of your decision-making power, and game design is all about making decisions—you need to make the best decisions possible, as fast as possible, and this slightly eccentric behavior is the way to do it. It’s always better to commit to an idea sooner, rather than later—you will get to a good decision much faster than if you bide your time considering potential alternatives. Just don’t fall in love with your decision and be ready to reverse it the moment it isn’t working for you.

## Chapter 9. The Game Is Made for a Player

> At one point in his career, Albert Einstein was asked by a small local organization to be the guest of honor at a luncheon and to give a lecture about his research. He agreed to do so. The luncheon was quite pleasant, and when the time came, the host anxiously announced that Albert Einstein, the famous scientist, was there to talk about his theories of special and general relativity. Einstein took the stage, and looking out a largely nonacademic audience consisting of mostly old ladies, he explained to them that he certainly could talk about his work, but it was a bit dull, and he was thinking perhaps instead the audience would prefer to hear him play the violin. The host and audience both agreed that it sounded like a fine idea. Einstein proceeded to play several pieces he knew well, creating a delightful experience the entire audience was able to enjoy and surely one they remembered for the rest of their lives.
>
> Einstein was able to create such a memorable experience because he knew his audience.
> 
> ...
> 
> As with everything else in game design, the key here is a kind of listening. You must learn to listen to your players, thoroughly and deeply.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Bartle’s Taxonomy of Player Types**
>
> 1. **♦ Achievers** want to achieve the goals of the game. Their primary pleasure is challenge.
> 
> 2. **♠ Explorers** want to get to know the breadth of the game. Their primary pleasure is discovery.
> 
> 3. **♥ Socializers** are interested in relationships with other people. They primarily seek the pleasures of fellowship.
> 
> 4. **♣ Killers** are interested in competing with and defeating others. This category does not map well to LeBlanc’s taxonomy. For the most part, it seems killers enjoy a mix of the pleasures of competition and destruction. Interestingly, Bartle characterizes them as primarily interested in “imposing themselves on others” and includes in this category people who are primarily interested in helping others.
> 
> Bartle also proposes a fascinating graph (Figure 9.4) that shows how the four types neatly cover a sort of space: that is, achievers are interested in acting on the world, explorers are interested in interacting with the world, socializers are interested in interacting with players, and killers are interested in acting on players.
> 
> ![Bartle Taxonomy Matrix](/.attachments/bartle.matrix.png)
> 
> **More Pleasure: MORE!**
>
> We must use caution when trying to make such simple taxonomies to describe something as complex as human desire. Under close scrutiny, both LeBlanc’s and Bartle’s taxonomies (and other similar lists) have gaps and when misused can gloss over subtle pleasures that might easily be missed, such as “destruction” and “nurturing,” which we encountered in our discussion of gender stereotypes. The following is a list of a few more pleasures to be considered:
>
> - **Anticipation**: When you know a pleasure is coming, just waiting for it is a kind of pleasure.
> 
> - **Completion**: It feels good to finish something. Many games take advantage of the pleasure of completion—any game where you have to “collect all the treasures,” “destroy all the bad guys,” or otherwise “clear the level” is taking advantage of this pleasure.
> 
> - **Delight in another’s misfortune**: Typically, we feel this when some unjust ­person suddenly gets their comeuppance. It is an important aspect of ­competitive games. The Germans call it schadenfreude (pronounced “shoddenfroyduh”).
> 
> - **Gift giving**: There is a unique pleasure when you make someone else happy through the surprise of a gift. We wrap our presents to heighten and intensify this surprise. The pleasure is not just that the person is happy but that you made them happy.
> 
> - **Humor**: Two unconnected things are suddenly united by a paradigm shift. It is hard to describe, but we all know it when it happens. Weirdly, it causes us to make a barking noise.
>
> - **Possibility**: This is the pleasure of having many choices and knowing you could pick any one of them. This is often experienced when shopping or at a buffet table.
> 
> - **Pride in an accomplishment**: This is a pleasure all its own that can persist long after the accomplishment was made. The Yiddish word naches (pronounced “nock-hess”) is about this kind of pleased satisfaction, usually referring to pride in children or grandchildren.
>
> - **Surprise**: The brain likes surprises.
> 
> - **Thrill**: There is a saying among roller coaster designers that “fear minus death equals fun.”Thrill is that kind of fun—you experience terror but feel secure in your safety.
> 
> - **Triumph over adversity**: This is that pleasure that you have accomplished something that you knew was a long shot. Typically, this pleasure is accompanied by shouts of personal triumph. The Italians have a word for this pleasure: fiero (pronounced fee-air-o).
> 
> - **Wonder**: An overwhelming feeling of awe and amazement. It almost always leads to a feeling of curiosity, which is how “wonder” gets its name.
>
> And there are many, many more. I list these pleasures that fall outside of easy classification to illustrate the richness of the pleasure space. Lists of pleasures can serve as convenient rules of thumb, but don’t forget to keep an open mind for ones that might not be on your list. Also keep in mind that pleasure is very context-sensitive. What might be very pleasurable in one context (dancing at a party) might be torturously embarrassing in another context (dancing at a job interview).

## Chapter 10. The Experience is in the Player's Mind

> The following are some of the key components necessary to create an activity that puts a player into a flow state:
> 
> - **Clear goals**: When our goals are clear, we are able to more easily stay focused on our task. When goals are unclear, we are not “into” our task, for we aren’t at all certain whether our current actions are useful.
> 
> - **No distractions**: Distractions steal focus from our task. No focus, no flow. This means engaging both mind and hands. Menial labor with no thought makes the mind wander; just sitting and thinking can make the hands fidget. These “itchy” feelings are each a kind of distraction.
> 
> - **Direct feedback**: If every time we take an action, we have to wait before we know what effect the action caused, we will quickly become distracted and lose focus on our task. When feedback is immediate, we can easily stay focused.
> 
> - **Continuously challenging**: Human beings love a challenge. But it must be a challenge we think we can achieve. If we start to think we can’t achieve it, we feel frustrated, and our minds start seeking an activity more likely to be rewarding. On the other hand, if the challenge is too easy, we feel bored, and again, our minds start seeking more rewarding activities.
> 
> Flow activities must manage to stay in the narrow margin of challenge that lies between boredom and frustration, for both of these unpleasant extremes cause our mind to change its focus to a new activity.

## Chapter 11. The Player's Mind is Driven by the Player's Motivation

> Surprisingly, Ryan and Deci suggest that we have precisely three mental needs:
> 
> 1. **Competence**: I need to feel good at something.
>
> 2. **Autonomy**: I need freedom to do things my own way.
>
> 3. **Relatedness**: I need to connect with other people.
>
> ...
> 
> For an interesting perspective on the motivations in your game, try putting each one on a matrix, where one axis is internal/external and the other is have-to/want-to. It is one more illustration of how richly complex and interesting human motivation can be.
> 
> ![Motivation Matrix](/.attachments/motivation.matrix-1.png)
> 
> ...
> 
> It is impossible to overestimate the importance of novelty as motivation in the realm of game design. Human beings are natural explorers, and we are always interested in that which is new.
> 
> ...
> 
> So do not despair at man’s insatiable appetite for novelty—instead, embrace it, and give the people what they want: something they have never experienced before.

## Chapter 12. Some Elements are Game Mechanics

> As with many things in game design, we do not have a universally ­agreed-upon taxonomy of game mechanics. One reason for this is that the mechanics of gameplay, even for simple games, tend to be quite complex and very difficult to ­disentangle. Attempts at simplifying these complex mechanics to the point of perfect ­mathematical understanding result in systems of description that are obviously incomplete. Economic “game theory” is an example of this. You would think with a name like “game theory,” it would be of great use to game designers, but in truth, it can only handle such simple systems that it is seldom useful for designing real games.
>
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 1: Space**
>
> Every game takes place in some kind of **space**. This space is the “magic circle” of gameplay. It defines the various places that can exist in a game and how those places are related to one another. As a game mechanic, space is a mathematical construct. We need to strip away all visuals, all aesthetics, and simply look at the abstract construction of a game’s space.
> 
> ...
> 
> At first glance, you might say it is a discrete 2D space, like a chessboard, with most of the middle cells missing. But it can be more simply represented as a 1D space—a single line of forty discrete points, which connects to itself in a loop. Sure, on the game board, the corner spaces look special because they are bigger, but ­functionally that doesn’t matter, since each game square is a zero-dimensional space. Multiple game pieces can be in a single game square, but their relative ­positions within that square are meaningless.
> 
> But not all game spaces are discrete. A pool table is an example of a continuous 2D space. It has a fixed length and width, and the balls can freely move about on the table, ricocheting off of the walls or falling into the holes, which are in fixed ­positions. Everyone would agree that the space is continuous, but is it 2D? Since clever players can sometimes cause the balls to leave the table and hop over each other, you could certainly argue that this is really a 3D game space, and for some purposes, it is useful to think of it that way. There are no hard and fast rules for these abstract functional spaces. When designing a new game, there are times it will be useful for you to think of your space as 2D and there are times when thinking of it as 3D is more useful. The same goes for continuous vs. discrete. The ­purpose of stripping down a game into a functional space is so that you can more easily think about it, without the distractions of aesthetics or the real world. If you are thinking about modifying the game of soccer to a playing field with new boundaries, you will probably think about it in terms of a 2D continuous space.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 2: Time**
> 
> In the real world, **time** is the most mysterious of dimensions. Against our will, we travel through it, ever forward, with no way to stop, turn around, slow down, or speed up. In the world of games, we often try to remedy this lack of control by creating toy worlds that let us play with time like gods.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 3: Objects**
> 
> A space without anything in it is, well, just a space. Your game space will surely have **objects** in it. Characters, props, tokens, scoreboards, or anything that can be seen or manipulated in your game falls into this category. Objects are the “nouns” of game mechanics. Technically, there are times you might consider the space itself an object, but usually the space of your game is different enough from other objects that it stands apart. Objects generally have one or more **attributes**, one of which is often the current position in the game space.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 4: Actions**
> 
> The next important game mechanic is the **action**. Actions are the “verbs” of game mechanics. There are two perspectives on actions or, put another way, two ways to answer the question “What can the players do?”
> 
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 5: Rules**
> 
> The **rules** are really the most fundamental mechanic. They define the space, the timing, the objects, the actions, the consequences of the actions, the constraints on the actions, and the goals. In other words, they make possible all the mechanics we have seen so far and add the crucial thing that makes a game a game—goals.
> 
> ...
> 
> Rules are the most fundamental of all game mechanics. A game is not just defined by its rules; a game is its rules.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 6: Skill**
> 
> The mechanic of **skill** shifts the focus away from the game and onto the player. Every game requires players to exercise certain skills. If the player’s skill level is a good match to the game’s difficulty, the player will feel challenged and stay in the flow channel.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Mechanic 7: Chance**
> 
> Our seventh and final game mechanic is **chance**. We deal with it last because it concerns interactions between all of the other six mechanics: space, time, objects, actions, rules, and skills.
> 
> Chance is an essential part of a fun game because chance means uncertainty, and uncertainty means surprises.

## Chapter 13. Game Mechanics Must be in Balance

> To novice designers, the business of balancing a game seems quite ­mysterious—but really, balancing a game is nothing more than adjusting the elements of the game until they deliver the experience you want.
> 
> ...
> 
> **The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance**
> 
> ***Balance Type #1: Fairness***
>
> One quality that players universally seek in games is fairness. Players want to feel that the forces working against them do not have an advantage that will make them impossible to defeat. One of the simplest ways to ensure this is to make your game symmetrical, that is, to give equal resources and powers to all players. Most traditional board games (such as checkers, chess, and Monopoly) and almost all sports use this method to be sure that no player has an unfair advantage over another.
> 
> ...
> 
> One simple way to balance elements for fairness is to make sure that whenever something in your game has an advantage over something else, yet another thing has an advantage over that! Often referred to as “circular balance,” the iconic example of this is the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors where
>
> - Rock breaks scissors
> - Scissors cut paper
> - Paper covers rock
>
> None of the elements can be supreme, because there is always another that can defeat it. It is a simple way to ensure that every game element has both strengths and weaknesses. Fighting games particularly like to use this technique to help ensure none of the warriors a player might choose are undefeatable.
>
> ...
> 
> ***Balance Type #2: Challenge vs. Success***
> 
> If play is too challenging, the player becomes frustrated. But if the player succeeds too easily, they can become bored. Keeping the player on the middle path means keeping the experiences of challenge and success in proper balance. This can be particularly difficult since players may have all different levels of skill. What one player finds boring, another may find challenging, and yet another may find frustrating. Some common techniques for striking a proper balance include the following:
> 
> - _Increase difficulty with each success_: This is a very common pattern in videogames—each level is harder than the last. Players build their skill until they can complete a level, only to be presented with one that challenges them yet again.
> 
> - _Let players get through easy parts fast_: Assuming your game has some method of gradually increasing the difficulty, you do yourself a service by allowing skilled players to finish a level quickly if they can easily master it. This way, skilled players will blow through easy levels, quickly getting to a challenge that is more interesting to them, while less skilled players will be challenged by the early levels. This lets every player quickly get to the part of the game that is a challenge. If you arrange it differently, such that each level takes one hour to play, regardless of skill level, skilled players may quickly grow bored from lack of challenge.
> 
> - _Create “layers of challenge”_: A popular pattern in games is to give a grade, or some number of stars, at the end of each level or mission. If you get a “D” or “F,” you must repeat the level, but if you get a “C” or better, you can continue. This creates a situation with a lot of flexibility in how you can play it. Novice players are thrilled to get a “C” and unlock the next level. As they gain experience and have unlocked all the levels, they may set themselves a new challenge—to earn an “A” (or even “A+”!) on earlier levels.
> 
> - _Let players choose the difficulty level_: A tried and true method is to let players choose to play on “easy, medium, or hard” modes. Some games (e.g., many Atari 2600 games) even let you change the difficulty-level midgame. The upside of this is that players can quickly find the appropriate challenge level for their skill level. The downside is that you have to create and balance multiple versions of your game. Also, it can detract from the “reality” of your game—players will argue over which version is the “real” one or be left feeling unsure whether any of them are “real.”
> 
> - _Playtest with a variety of players_: Many designers fall into a trap of only testing with people who are constantly exposed to the game and end up designing a game that is too frustrating for novices. Others fall into the opposite trap and only test their game with people who have never played before. They end up designing a game that experienced players quickly grow bored with. Wise designers playtest with a mix of skilled and novice players, to be sure that their game is fun at first, fun after a while, and fun much, much later.
> 
> - _Give the losers a break_: _Mario Kart_ is famous for its unusual system of giving out power-ups. Players who are ahead in the race get meager power-ups, while players who are far behind get the good stuff, allowing them to race ahead. This is a great system for that game because it feels more fair and keeps everyone engaged: players who are behind need to pay attention because a game-­changing power-up could come at any second, and players who are ahead cannot afford to rest on their laurels because that “blue shell” could hit them at any time. This tricky system does a great job at nudging all players to the center of the flow channel.
> 
> ...
> 
> Many designers are so afraid of players beating their game too easily that they make later levels so fiendishly difficult to win that 90% of players eventually give up on the game in frustration. These designers hope that the increased challenge will extend the play time—and there is something to that—if you have expended forty hours to get through level nine, you will probably be willing to work pretty hard to defeat level ten. But in truth, there are so many competing games to play that many players just give up in frustration. On the other hand, with a free to play game, this late-game frustration might be just what you want, to spur players to pay money and move toward completion. As a designer, it makes sense to ask yourself, “What percentage of players do I want to be able to complete this game?” and then design for that.
>
> ...
> 
> ***Balance Type #3: Meaningful Choices***
> 
> There are many different ways to give a player choices in a game. Meaningful choices for a player lead them to ask themselves questions, such as the following:
> 
> - Where should I go?
> 
> - How should I spend my resources?
> 
> - What should I practice and try to perfect?
> 
> - How should I dress my character?
> 
> - Should I try to get through the game quickly or carefully?
> 
> - Should I focus on offense or defense?
> 
> - What strategy should I use in this situation?
> 
> - Which power should I choose?
> 
> - Should I play it safe or take a big risk?
> 
> A good game gives the player meaningful choices. Not just any choices but choices that will have a real impact on what happens next and how the game turns out. Many designers fall into the trap of offering the player meaningless choices; for example, in a racing game, you might have 50 vehicles to choose from, but if they all drive the same way, it is like having no choice at all. Other designers fall into a different trap—offering choices that no one would want. You might offer a soldier ten guns, all different, but if one of them is clearly better than the rest, again it is like having no choice at all.
> 
> When choices are offered to a player, but one of them is clearly better than the rest, this is called a **dominant strategy**. Once a dominant strategy is discovered, the game is no longer fun, because the puzzle of the game has been solved—there are no more choices to make. When you discover that a game you are working on has a dominant strategy, you must change the rules (balance things) so that this strategy no longer dominates and meaningful choice can be restored to the game.
> 
> Michael Mateas points out that the number of choices a player seeks is dependent on the number of things they desire:
>
> - If choices > desires, then the player is overwhelmed.
> - If choices < desires, the player is frustrated.
> - If choices = desires, the player has a feeling of freedom and fulfillment.
>
> So, to properly determine the number of choices, you need to figure out the types and number of things the player would like to do.
> 
> ...
> 
> One of the most exciting and interesting choices for a player to make is whether to play it safe and go for a small reward or take a big risk to try for a big reward. This is a hard decision to make, if the game is balanced properly. I find that about eight out of ten times someone comes to me asking for help on a game prototype that “just isn’t fun”; the game is missing this kind of meaningful choice. You could call this “balanced asymmetric risk,” since you are balancing a low risk with low reward against a high risk for high reward, but that is kind of a mouthful. This relationship comes up so often, and is so important, that I like to give it a shorter name: **triangularity**. The player is one point of the triangle, the low-risk choice is the second point, and the high-risk choice
is the third.
> 
> ... Without the flying saucer, Space Invaders gets quite tedious, because your choices are few—you just shoot and shoot and shoot. With the flying saucer, you occasionally have a ery difficult, meaningful choice to make—should you play it safe or take a risk and go for the big points?
> 
> ...
> 
> A classic example of triangularity appears in the book _Hackers_ by Steven Levy. An MIT engineer hacked a vending machine giving each user a choice: get your snack from the vending machine for normal price as usual or take a chance. A digital coin could be flipped, resulting in your snack either costing double or being completely free.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Balancing Type #4: Skill vs. Chance***
> 
> ... Too much chance negates the effects of player skill and vice versa. There is no easy answer for this one—some players prefer games with as few elements of chance as possible, and other players prefer the opposite. Games of skill tend to be more like athletic contests—systems of judgment that determine which player is the best. Games of chance often have a more relaxed, casual nature—after all, much of the outcome is up to fate.
> 
> One very common method of balancing these is to alternate the use of chance and skill in a game. For example, dealing out a hand of cards is pure chance—but choosing how to play them is pure skill. Rolling a die to see how far you move is pure chance—deciding where to move your piece is pure skill. This can create an alternating pattern of tension and relaxation that can be very pleasing to players.
> 
> Designer David Perry advises that the key to addictive game design is designing your game such that players are doing three things at all times: exercising a skill, taking risks, and working a strategy. And it is certainly true that any time players are taking risks, they are up against chance, in some way.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Balancing Type #5: Head vs. Hands***
> 
> This type of balancing is quite straightforward: how much of the game should involve doing a challenging physical activity (be it steering, throwing, or pushing buttons dexterously), and how much of it should involve thinking? These two things are not as separate as they might seem on the surface—many games involve constant strategizing and puzzle solving while simultaneously pulling off feats of speed and dexterity.
> 
> ...
> 
> It is important, though, to understand what your target market prefers in a game—more thinking or more dexterity? And it is equally important that your game clearly communicate what balance you have chosen to put into it.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Balance Type #6: Competition vs. Cooperation***
> 
> Competition and cooperation are basic, animal urges. All higher animals are driven to compete against others partly for survival and partly to establish their status in the community. Opposite of that, there is also a basic instinct to cooperate with others, since a team, with its many eyes and hands and its diverse abilities, is always more powerful than an individual. Competition and cooperation are so important to our survival that we need to experiment with them—partly to get better at them and partly to learn about our friends and family—so we get a better sense of who is good at what and how we can work together. Games provide a very socially safe way to explore how the people around us behave in stressful situations—this is a secret reason we like to play games together.
> 
> Some games find interesting ways to blend competition and cooperation. The arcade game Joust can be played solo, where a player competes against many ­computer-controlled enemies, or it can be played in a two-player mode, where both players compete against enemies together in the same arena. There is a tension between competition and cooperation in Joust that is very interesting: On the competitive side, the players get points based on how many enemies they defeat, and they can battle each other if they choose. But on the cooperative side, players can get higher scores overall if they coordinate their attacks and protect each other.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Balance Type #7: Short vs. Long***
> 
> One important thing to balance in every game is the length of the gameplay. If the game is too short, players may not get a chance to develop and execute meaningful strategies. But if the game goes on too long, players may grow bored, or they may avoid the game because playing it requires too much of a time commitment.
> 
> ...
> 
> The main factors that determine when a game ends are the win or lose conditions. By altering these conditions, you can dramatically change the length of the game. The designers of the arcade game Spy Hunter came up with a very interesting system to balance the length of their game. In Spy Hunter, you drive a car that fires machine guns at enemies on a highway. In early prototypes, when your car was destroyed three times, the game was over. The game is very challenging, particularly for novice players, and the designers found that these players were having very short games and feeling frustrated—so they introduced a new rule: For the first ninety seconds of gameplay, the player has an unlimited supply of cars—they cannot lose the game during this time. After that time is up, they only have a few cars, and when they are destroyed, the game is over.

> ***Balance Type #8: Rewards***
> 
> Why is it that people will spend so much time playing a videogame, just to get a good score? We have talked earlier about how games become structures of judgment and that people want to be judged. But people don’t just want any judgment—they want to be judged favorably. Rewards are the way the game tells the player “you have done well.”
> 
> There are several common types of rewards that games tend to give. Each is different, but they all have one thing in common—they fulfill the player’s desires.
> 
> - **Praise**: The simplest of rewards, the game just tells you that you did good work, through either an explicit statement, a special sound effect, or even an in-game character speaking to you. It all amounts to the same thing: the game has judged you, and it approves. Nintendo games are famous for giving players lots of ­secondary praise via sounds and animations for every reward they get.
> 
> - **Points**: In many games, points serve no purpose than a measure of the player’s success, be it through skill or luck. Sometimes these points are a gateway to another reward, but often, this measurement of your success is enough—­particularly if others can see it on a high score list.
> 
> - **Prolonged play**: In many games (pinball, for example), the goal of the game is to risk resources (in pinball, your ball) to rack up as many points as possible without losing what you have put at risk (your ball down the drain). In games with this structure of “lives,” the most valuable reward a player can get is an extra life. Other games that have time limits reward players by adding time to their play session, which really amounts to the same thing. Prolonged play is desirable because it allows for a higher score and a measure of success, but it also taps into our natural human drive for survival. Modern free to play games have a slight twist on this with the “energy” model. Run out of energy, and play is paused until you pay for more or until a certain number of hours pass.
> 
> - **A gateway**: While we have a desire to be judged favorably, we also have a desire to explore. Game structures that reward success by moving you to new parts of the game satisfy this basic urge. Anytime you earn access to a new level or win a key to a locked door, you have received a gateway reward.
> 
> - **Spectacle**: We like to enjoy beautiful and interesting things. Often, games will play music or show animations as a simple reward. The “intermission” at the end of level 2 in Pac-Man was probably the first example of this in a videogame. This kind of reward seldom satisfies players on its own, so it tends to be paired with other types of rewards.
> 
> - **Expression**: Many players like to express themselves within a game with special clothes or decorations. Even though these often have nothing to do with a goal in the game, they can be great fun for a player and satisfy a basic urge to make a mark on the world.
> 
> - **Powers**: Becoming more powerful is something that everyone desires in real life, and in a game, becoming more powerful is likely to improve the game’s judgment of a player’s success. These powers can come in many forms: getting “kinged” in checkers, becoming tall in _Super Mario World_, speeding up in _Sonic the Hedgehog_, and getting special weaponry in _Call of Duty_. The thing all powers have in common is that they give you a way to reach your goal more quickly than you could before.
> 
> - **Resources**: While casino games and lotteries reward the player with real money, videogames more frequently reward the player with resources they can only use in the game (e.g., food, energy, ammunition, hit points). Some games, instead of giving resources directly, give virtual money that the player can choose how to spend. Usually the things that one can buy with this money are resources, powers, prolonged play, or expression. Free to play games, of course, blur this distinction by letting you spend real money to get virtual money (but almost never the other way around).
> 
> - **Status**: High leaderboard rankings, special achievements, or anything else that gives a player higher status in the community of players can be very desirable award, especially to competitive players.
> 
> - **Completion**: Completing all the goals in a game gives a special feeling of closure to players that they seldom get from solving problems in real life. In many games, this is the ultimate reward—when you have reached this point, there is often no point in playing the game any further.
> 
> ...
> 
> But how to balance these rewards? That is, how many should be given out, and which ones? This is a difficult question, and the answer is different for almost every game. Generally, the more types of rewards you can work into your game, the better. Two other reward rules of thumb from the world of psychology include the following:
> 
> - People have a tendency to get acclimated to rewards the more they receive them, and what was rewarding an hour ago is no big deal now. One simple method many games use to overcome this is to gradually increase the value of the rewards as the player progresses in the game. In a way, this is a cheesy trick, but it works—even when you know the designer is doing it and why, it still feels very rewarding to suddenly get bigger rewards in conjunction with getting to a new part of a game.
> 
> - The power of _variable rewards_ over fixed ones has been proven in thousands of psychological experiments. For example, if every monster you defeat gives you ten points, that gets predictable and boring pretty quickly—but if every monster you defeat has a 2/3 chance of giving you zero points, but a 1/3 chance of giving you thirty points, this stays rewarding for a much longer time, even though you are receiving the same number of points on average. It’s like bringing donuts to work—if you bring them every Friday, people will come to expect them and take them for granted. But if you bring them every now and then on random days, they are a delightful surprise each time. Part of what makes triangularity so interesting to players is its connection to variable reward.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Balance Type #9: Punishment***
> 
> The idea of a game that punishes the player can seem a little strange—aren’t games supposed to be fun? Paradoxically, though, punishment used properly can increase the enjoyment that players get from games. Here are some reasons that a game might punish players:
> 
> - **Punishment creates endogenous value**: We’ve talked about the importance of creating value within a game. Resources in a game are worth more if there is a chance they can be taken away.
> 
> - **Taking risks is exciting**: Particularly if the potential rewards are balanced against the risks! But you can only take risks if there are negative consequences or punishments. Giving players a chance to risk terrible consequences makes success much, much sweeter.
> 
> - **Possible punishment increases challenge**: We’ve discussed the importance of challenging players—when failure means a punishing setback in the game, the challenge of play increases. Increasing the punishment that comes with failure can be one way to increase the challenge.
>
> Here are some common types of punishment used in games. Many of them are simply rewards in reverse.
> 
> - **Shaming**: The opposite of praise, this is simply the game telling you that you are doing a bad job. This can happen with explicit messages (e.g., “Missed” or “Defeated!”) or with discouraging animations, sound effects, and music.
> 
> - **Loss of points**: Players find this type of punishment so painful that it is relatively rare in videogames or even in traditional games and sports. Maybe it is less an issue of it being painful and more of the fact that when players can lose points, it cheapens the value of the earned points. Points that can’t be taken away are very valuable—points that could be subtracted on the next bad move have less endogenous value.
> 
> - **Shortened play**: “Losing a life” in a game is an example of this kind of punishment. Some games that work on a timer will shorten play by taking time off the clock.
> 
> - **Terminated play**: Game over, man.
> 
> - **Setback**: When, after dying, a game returns you to the start of a level, or to the last checkpoint, this is a setback punishment. In games that are all about proceeding to the end, a setback is a very logical punishment. The balancing challenge is to figure out exactly where the checkpoints belong to make the punishments seem meaningful, but not unreasonable.
> 
> - **Removal of powers**: The designer must tread carefully here—players greatly treasure the powers they have earned, and to have them taken away may feel unfair to them. In Ultima Online, players who were killed in battle turned into ghosts. To come back to life, they had to find their way to a shrine. If they took too long getting there, they would lose valuable skill points that had taken weeks to earn. Many players felt this was too harsh a punishment. One way to remove powers fairly is to take them away temporarily. Some amusement parks feature bumper car battle tanks that shoot tennis balls at each other. The tanks have targets on each side, and if an opponent hits one of your targets with a tennis ball, your tank goes into an uncontrolled spin for five seconds and your gun becomes inoperable during that time.
> 
> - **Resource depletion**: Loss of money, goods, ammunition, shields, or hit points fall into this category. This is one of the most common types of game punishment.
> 
> One thing that psychological study has shown is that reward is always a better tool for reinforcement than punishment. Whenever possible, if you need to encourage a player to do something, it is better to use a reward than a punishment, if you can.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Balance Type #10: Freedom vs. Controlled Experience***
> 
> Games are interactive, and the point of interactivity is to give the player control, or freedom, over the experience. But how much control? Giving the player control over everything is not only more work for the game developer; it can also be boring for the player! After all, a game isn’t meant to be a simulation of real life, but rather more interesting than real life—this sometimes means cutting out boring, complex, or unnecessary decisions and actions. One simple kind of game balance that every designer must consider is where to give the player freedom and how much freedom to give.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Balance Type #11: Simple vs. Complex***
> 
> Simplicity and complexity of game mechanics can seem very paradoxical. Calling a game “simple” can be a criticism, such as “so simple it is boring.” It can also be a compliment: “so simple and elegant!” Complexity can also be a double-edged sword. Games are criticized as “overly complex and confusing” or complimented as “richly and intricately complex.” To make sure your game has the “good simplicity” and the “good complexity,” but not the bad, we need to look at the nature of simplicity and complexity in games and how to strike the right balance between them.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Emergent complexity** can be difficult to achieve, but is worth the effort. Ideally, one can create a simple ruleset out of which emerges the thing every game designer strives for: balanced surprises. If you can design a simple game that becomes a factory for a never-ending stream of balanced surprises, people will play your game for centuries to come. The only way to find out whether you have achieved this is to keep playing and changing your game over and over until the surprises start to come.
> 
> So, if emergent complexity is so great, why would anyone make a game that is innately complex? Well, sometimes you need the **innate complexity** to simulate a real-world situation, such as re-creating a historical battle. Other times, you add more innate complexity to balance your game a little better. The pawns in chess have movement rules that are innately complex: when they move, they can only move forward one square, into an unoccupied space, unless it is their first move, in which case they can move one or two spaces. One exception to this is when they are capturing another piece; in that case, they can only move diagonally forward, but only one square, even if it is their first move.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Balance Type #12: Detail vs. Imagination***
> 
> Deciding exactly what details should be provided and which should be left to the player’s imagination is a different but important kind of balance to strike. Here are some tips for how to do it well.
> 
> - **Only detail what you can do well**: Players have rich, detailed imaginations. If there is something you need to present that is of lower quality than your players will be able to imagine, don’t do it—let the imagination do the heavy lifting! Let’s say you would like to play recorded dialog for your whole game, but you don’t have the budget for quality voice actors or you don’t have the storage space for all that dialog. An engineer might suggest trying speech synthesis, that is, letting the computer speak for the characters. After all, it is cheap, requires no storage space, and can be tuned somewhat to sound like different characters, right? All that is true—but also, it will make everyone sound like a robot, and unless you are making a game about robots, your players will not be able to take it seriously. An even cheaper alternative is to use subtitles. Some people might claim that this means there is no voice at all! But that isn’t true. The player’s imagination will fill in a voice—a voice far better than the one you will be able to synthesize. This same idea goes for just about everything in the game: scenery, sound effects, characters, animations, and special effects. If you can’t do it well, try to find a way to leave it to the player’s imagination.
> 
> - **Give details the imagination can use**: Players have a lot to learn when they come to a new game—any clear details you can give them that make the game easier to understand will be welcome. Consider the game of chess. It is mostly a somewhat abstract game, but some interesting details have been filled in. The game is set in a medieval era, and the pieces, which easily could have been numbered or just made as abstract shapes, are given the roles of people in a medieval court. It isn’t a lot of detail—the kings, for example, don’t have names, and we know nothing about their kingdoms or their policies—but none of that matters. In fact, if this were to be a real simulation of an army between two kingdoms, the rules of movement and capture would make no sense at all! What matters about the “kings” in chess is that the tallest of the chess pieces has movements that are slightly evocative of a real king. He is important and must move slowly and must be carefully guarded. Any other details can be left to the imaginations of the players to fill in as they see fit. Similarly, picturing the “knights” as horses helps us remember that they can jump around the board in ways the others cannot. By giving details that help our imaginations better grasp their functionality, the game becomes much more accessible to us.
> 
> - **Familiar worlds do not need much detail**: If you are creating a simulation of something that the player is likely to know very well, such as a city street or a house interior, you have little need to simulate every little detail—since the player already knows what these places are like, they will quickly fill them in with imagination, if you give them a few relevant details. If the point of your game, though, is to educate someone about a place they have never been before, imagination will be of little help, and you will find it necessary to fill in a great deal of detail.
> 
> - **Use the binocular effect**: When spectators bring binoculars to an opera or a sporting event, they use them mostly at the beginning of the event, to get a close-up view of the different players or performers. Once this close-up view has been put into memory, the glasses can be set aside, for now the imagination goes to work, filling in the close-ups on the tiny distant figures. Video games replicate this effect all the time, often by showing a close-up of a character at the beginning of the game who is going to be an inch-high sprite for the rest of the experience. It is an easy way to use a little detail to get a lot of imagination.
> 
> - **Give details that inspire imagination**: Again, chess is a great example. To be able to control all the members of a royal army is a fantasy that the mind quickly takes to—and of course, it is a fantasy—it only has to be tied to reality by a thin thread. Giving players situations they can easily fantasize about lets their imagination take wing, and all kinds of imaginary details will quickly crystallize around one little detail that the designer provided.

## Chapter 14. Game Mechanics Support Puzzles

> The thing that really seems to bother people about calling puzzles games is that they are not replayable. Once you figure out the best strategy, you can solve the puzzle every time, and it is no longer fun. Games are not usually this way. Most games have enough dynamic elements that each time you play you are confronted again with a new set of problems to solve.
> 
> ...
> 
> Contrast that to The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, which has many puzzles but smoothly integrates them into environments in the game. When confronted with a river of lava, you have to figure out how to throw water jugs in the right pattern so that you can cross the river. When you are in a dungeon where the doors are opened and closed by a complex series of switches, you must figure out how to use items found in the dungeon (statues, etc.) to flip the switches so you can successfully get through all the doors. Some of these are quite complex; for example, some enemies in the dungeon are paralyzed when light falls on them. To get the doors open, you must lure the enemies onto the right switches and then shoot flaming arrows near enough to paralyze them to keep the door open so you can run out. But in all cases, the puzzle elements are natural parts of the environment, and the goals of solving the puzzle are direct goals of the player’s avatar.
> 
> ...
> 
> Can other genres include puzzles? Absolutely. When you play a fighting game and you have to stop and think about which strategies are going to work best against a particular opponent, you are solving a puzzle. When you play a racing game and are trying to figure out where on the track to use your turbo booster to finish the race in less than a minute, you are solving a puzzle. When you play a first-person shooter and you think about which order you should shoot the enemies so that you take the least damage, you are solving a puzzle.

## Chapter 15. Players Play Games through an Interface

> Like many things we encounter in game design, interface is not simple or easily described. “Interface” can mean many things—a game controller, a display device, a system of manipulating a virtual character, the way the game communicates information to the player, and many other things. To avoid confusion and to understand it properly, we need to separate it out into component parts.
> 
> ...
> 
> Information flows in a loop from player to game to player to game, round and round. It is almost like this flow pushes a waterwheel that generates experience when it spins. But it can’t be just any information that flows around this loop. The information that is returned to the player by the game dramatically affects what the player will do next. This information is generally called **feedback**, and the quality of this feedback can exert a powerful influence on how much the player understands and enjoys what is happening in your game.
> 
> The importance of good feedback is easily overlooked. One example is the net on a basketball hoop. The net does not affect the gameplay at all—but it slows the ball as it descends from the hoop, so that all players can clearly see, and even hear, that it went in.
> 
> ...
> 
> One kind of interface that tends to be associated with juicy fun is the touch interface found on phones and tablets. Touch interfaces have done a lot to change the world of gaming in a very short time. Young children, in particular, seem to take to touch interfaces with surprising ease. But why? The obvious answer is “because they are intuitive.”
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Step 1: List and Prioritize Information***
> 
> A game has to present a lot of information, but it is not all equally important. ... We might begin by listing all of the information the player needs
to see. ... Now, we might sort these by importance:
> 
> **Need to know every moment:**
> 
> ...
> 
> **Need to glance at from time to time while playing:**
> 
> ...
> 
> **Need to know only occasionally:**
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Step 2: List Channels***
> 
> A channel of information is just a way of communicating a stream of data. ... Some possible channels of information might be
> - The top center of the screen
> - The bottom right of the screen
> - My avatar
> - Game sound effects
> - Game music
> - The border of the game screen
> - The chest of the approaching enemy
> - The word balloon over a character’s head
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Step 3: Map Information to Channels***
> 
> Now, the difficult task comes of mapping the types of information to the different channels.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Step 4: Review Use of Dimensions***
> 
> A channel of information in a game can have several dimensions.

## Chapter 16. Experiences Can Be Judged by Their Interest Curves

> Interest curves can be a very useful tool when creating an entertainment ­experience. By charting out the level of expected interest over the course of an experience, trouble spots often become clear and can be corrected. Further, when observing guests having the experience, it is useful to compare their level of observed interest to the level of interest that you, as an entertainer, anticipated they would have. Often, plotting different curves for different demographics is a useful exercise. Depending on your experience, it might be great for some groups but boring for others (e.g., “guy movies” vs. “chick flicks”), or it might be an experience with “something for everyone,” meaning well-structured curves for several ­different demographic groups.
> 
> Once you start thinking about games and entertainment experiences in terms of interest curves, you start seeing the pattern of the good interest curve everywhere. You can see it in the three-act structure of a Hollywood movie. You can see it in the structure of popular songs (musical intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, big finish). When Aristotle says that every tragedy has a complication and a denouement, you can see it there. When comedians talk about the “rule of three,” you can see the interest curve.
> 
> ...
> 
> To determine the interest level, you have to experience it with your whole self, using your empathy and imagination and using skills of the right brain as well as the left. Still, your left brain may be happy to know that overall interest can be broken down further into other factors. There are many ways to do that, but I like to use these three:
> 
> ***Factor 1: Inherent Interest***
> 
> Some events are simply more interesting than others. Generally, risk is more ­interesting than safety, fancy is more interesting than plain, and the unusual is more interesting than the ordinary. Dramatic change and the potential for dramatic change are always interesting. Accordingly, a story about a man wrestling an alligator is probably going to be more interesting than a story about a man eating a cheese sandwich. We simply have internal drives that push us to be more interested in some things than others.
> 
> The events don’t stand alone, however. They build on one another, creating what is often called the story arc. Part of the inherent interest of events depends on how they relate to one another. For example, in the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, most of the events in the story aren’t very interesting: Goldilocks eats ­porridge, sits in chairs, and takes a nap. But these boring events make possible the more interesting part of the story where the bears discover their home has been disturbed.
> 
> ***Factor 2: Poetry of Presentation***
> 
> This refers to the aesthetics of the entertainment experience. The more beautiful the artistry used in presenting the experience, whether that artistry be writing, music, dance, acting, comedy, cinematography, graphic design, or whatever, the more interesting and compelling the guests will find it. Of course, if you can give a beautiful presentation to something that is inherently interesting in the first place, all the better.
> 
> ***Factor 3: Projection***
> 
> This is the extent to which you compel a guest to use their powers of empathy and imagination to put themselves into the experience. This factor is crucial to understanding the commonality between story and gameplay and requires some explanation.
> 
> ...
> 
> In terms of trying to build projection, imagination is as important as empathy. Humans exist in two worlds: the outward-facing world of perception and the inward-facing world of imagination. Every entertainment experience creates its own little world in the imagination. This world does not have to be realistic (although it might be), but it does need to be internally consistent. When the world is consistent and compelling, it fills the guest’s imagination, and mentally, the guest enters the world. We often say that the guest is “immersed” in the world. This kind of immersion increases projection, boosting the overall interest of the guest significantly. The suspension of disbelief that keeps the guest immersed in the story world is fragile indeed. One small contradiction is all it takes to bring the guest back to reality and “take them out” of the experience.
> 
> ...
> 
> Another way to build up the player’s projection into the world you have ­created is to provide multiple ways to enter that world. Many people think of toys and games based on popular movies or television shows as nothing but a gimmicky way to make a few extra dollars by riding the coattails of a successful entertainment experience. But these toys and games provide new ways for children to access an established fantasy world. The toys let them spend more time in that world, and the longer they spend imagining they are in the fantasy world, the greater their projection into that world and the characters in it becomes.
> 
> Interactive entertainment has an even more remarkable advantage, in terms of projection. The guest can be the main character. The events actually happen to the guest and are all the more interesting for that reason. Also, unlike story-based entertainment, where the story world exists only in the guest’s imagination, interactive entertainment creates significant overlap between perception and imagination, allowing the guest to directly manipulate and change the story world. This is why videogames can present events with little inherent interest or poetry but still be compelling to guests. What they lack in inherent interest and poetry of ­presentation, they can often make up for in projection.
> 
> ...
> 
> Some people find it useful to qualify the types of interest that happen at different points in their experience, letting you see which types of interest are holding the audience’s interest at different times, creating graphs that look something like:
> 
> ![Interest Curve showing Projection, Poetry and Inherent Interest](/.attachments/interest.curve.png)

## Chapter 17. One Kind of Experience Is the Story

> Stories and games can each be thought of as machines that help create experiences.
> 
> ...
> 
> The idea that the mechanics of traditional storytelling, which are innate to the human ability to communicate, are somehow nullified by interactivity is absurd. It is a poorly told story that doesn’t compel the listener to think and make decisions during the telling. When one is engaged in any kind of storyline, interactive or not, one is continually making decisions: “What will happen next?” “What should the hero do?” “Where did that rabbit go?” “Don’t open that door!” The difference only comes in the participant’s ability to take action. The desire to act and all the thoughts and emotions that go with that are present in both. A masterful storyteller knows how to create this desire within a listener’s mind and then knows exactly how and when (and when not) to fulfill it. This skill translates well into interactive media, although it is made more difficult because the storyteller must predict, account for, respond to, and smoothly integrate the actions of the participant into the experience.

## Chapter 20. Worlds Contain Characters

> If we are to create games that have great stories in them, these stories must contain memorable characters. It is an important question to ask: How are characters in games different than characters in other media? If we examine fictional characters in various media side by side, some differences become apparent. Here are some samples I chose from lists of the best novels, films, and videogames of the twentieth century.
> 
> ...
> 
> So, examining these lists, what patterns do we see?
> 
> - **Mental → Physical**. The characters in the novels are involved in deep psychic struggles. This makes sense, since in a novel we spend much of our time l­istening to the characters’ innermost thoughts. The characters in the movies are involved in both emotional and physical struggles, which are resolved through c­ ombinations of communication and action. Again, when you consider the medium, this makes sense: We cannot hear the thoughts of film characters, but we can see what they say and do. Finally, the game characters are involved in conflicts that are almost entirely physical. Since these characters mostly have no thoughts (the player does the thinking for them) and are only occasionally able to speak, this again makes perfect sense. In all three cases, the characters are defined by their media.
> 
> - **Reality → Fantasy**. The novels tend to be very reality based; the films tend to be rooted in reality, but often pushing toward fantasy, and the game worlds are almost entirely fantasy situations. And the characters reflect this—they are ­products of their environment.
> 
> - **Complex → Simple**. For a variety of reasons, the complexity of the plots and depth of the characters gradually diminishes as we move from novels to games.
> 
> ...
> 
> Designers often debate about which is more immersive: the first- or third-­person view. One argument is that greater projection can be achieved by providing a first-person perspective on a scene with no visible avatar. However, the power of e­mpathy is strong, and when controlling a visible avatar, guests often wince in imagined pain upon seeing their avatar suffer a blow or sigh in relief upon seeing their avatar escape physical harm. It is almost as if the avatar is a kind of kinesthetic voodoo doll for the guest. Bowlers are another example of this phenomenon, as they try to exert “body English” on a bowling ball as it rolls down the lane toward the pins. These movements are largely subconscious and are a result of a bowler projecting themself onto the ball. In this sense, the bowling ball serves as the bowler’s avatar.
> 
> And it is one thing to project ourselves into our avatar as if our avatar is a tool, but the experience of projection can be so much more powerful if we actually relate to the character in some way. So, what kinds of characters are best suited for players to project themselves into?
> 
> ***The Ideal Form***
> 
> The first type of character that is a good choice as an avatar is the kind that the player has always wanted to be. Characters like this—such as mighty warriors, powerful wizards, attractive princesses, ultra-suave secret agents—exert a pull on the psyche, since the force inside us that pushes us toward being our best finds the idea of projecting ourselves into an idealized form very appealing. Although these characters are not much like our real selves at all, they are people we sometimes dream about being.
> 
> ***The Blank Slate***
> 
> ... the less detail that goes into a character, the more opportunity the reader has to project themselves into that character.
> 
> ...
> 
> This idea has bearing well beyond the domain of comics. In videogames, we see the same phenomenon. Some of the most popular and compelling avatars are ones that are very iconic. Consider Mario: He isn’t much of an idealized form, but he is simple, hardly speaks, and is completely nonthreatening, so it is easy to project yourself into him.
> 
> The idealized form and the blank slate are often mixed. Consider Spider-Man, for example. He is an ideal form: a powerful and brave superhero, but the mask that covers his face makes him almost completely iconic—a blank slate that could be almost anyone.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Creating Compelling Game Characters**
> 
> Here I will summarize some of the methods I have found most useful for developing characters in games.
> 
> ***Character Tip #1: List Character Functions***
> 
> A very useful technique when coming up with the cast of characters in your game is to list all the functions that these characters need to fulfill. Then list the characters you had been thinking of putting in the game, and see how they match up. For example, if you are making an action platform game, your list might look like the following:
> 
> 1. Hero: the character who plays the game
> 2. Mentor: gives advice and useful items
> 3. Assistant: gives occasional tips
> 4. Tutor: explains how to play the game
> 5. Final boss: someone to have the last battle against
> 6. Minions: bad guys
> 7. Three bosses: tough guys to battle against
> 8. Hostage: someone to rescue
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Character Tip #2: Define and Use Character Traits***
> 
> You want to choose traits that are going to stay with your character through many situations that really define them as a person. Sometimes these can be a little contradictory, but real people have contradictory traits, so why shouldn’t characters? Let’s say we gave Sabu and Lester these traits:
> 
>   _Sabu: trustworthy, short tempered, valiant, a fiery lover_
>   _Lester: arrogant, sarcastic, spiritual, impulsive_
> 
> ...

> ***Character Tip #3: Use the Interpersonal Circumplex***
> 
> Your characters won’t be alone, of course—they are going to interact with each other. One tool that Katherine Isbister brought from the world of social psychology into the world of game design is the **interpersonal circumplex**. It is a graph you can use to visualize the relationships between characters. It has two axes: friendliness and dominance.
>

> The circumplex is not a be-all or end-all tool, but it can be useful for thinking about character relationships because of the questions it can prompt. So, let’s put it in our toolbox.

> 
> ...
> 
> ***Character Tip #4: Make a Character Web***
> 
> The circumplex is a nice visual way to see some character relationships. But there can be many other factors in the relationships between your characters. The character web is a good way to explore how the characters feel about each other and why. The idea is simple: To analyze a character, write down what that character thinks of all the other characters. Here’s an example from the world of Archie comics:
> ...
> 
> **Archie**
> - **Veronica**: Archie is lured by her elegance and beauty. Though she is rich, Archie doesn’t care much about that.
> - **Betty**: Archie’s true love, but her insecurity constantly gives him mixed signals, so he doesn’t pursue her as forcefully as he might.
> - **Reggie**: Archie shouldn’t trust Reggie, but he often does, because Archie always tries to be a nice guy and Archie is kind of gullible.
> - **Jughead**: Archie’s best friend. What they have in common is that they are both underdogs.
> 
> **Veronica**
> - **Archie**: Veronica finds Archie attractive, but sometimes she seeks to date him to frustrate Betty and because she can always feel superior around him.
> - **Betty**: Veronica trusts Betty as a friend because they were friends as little girls. Veronica likes how she can always feel superior to Betty in terms of wealth and class, but it really frustrates Veronica that Betty is a better person.
> - **Reggie**: Reggie is an attractive buffoon who appreciates wealth, but Veronica gets frustrated that Reggie doesn’t really respect or love her.
> - **Jughead**: A nauseating freak—Veronica can’t understand why Archie is friends with him. Veronica often bribes him with food to get what she wants.
> 
> **Betty**
> - **Archie**: Her true love. She is shy, though, about telling him how she really feels, because Betty has low self-esteem.
> - **Veronica**: Betty’s BFF. She can be mean sometimes, and she is too money crazy, but friends are friends forever, so Betty stays with Veronica.
> - **Reggie**: Betty is intimidated by his wealth and showy attempts at class. She feels like she is supposed to like him, but secretly she is repelled by him.
> - **Jughead**: Betty thinks he’s cute and funny and glad that he’s such a good friend to her true love.
> 
> **Reggie**
> - **Archie**: Reggie’s archrival. Reggie can’t imagine what anyone sees in such a dopey nice guy. Occasionally, Reggie envies Archie’s popularity, but he always thinks he can find a tricky way to outdo Archie.
> - **Veronica**: Reggie finds her attractive and rich—he likes the power of her wealth.
> - **Betty**: Reggie finds her attractive, and though her low self-esteem is a turnoff, to be able to win her, he would show his superiority over Archie.
> - **Jughead**: Reggie sees him as a total loser who deserves to be bullied, especially since he is friends with Archie.
> 
> **Jughead**
> - **Archie**: Jughead’s best friend, and the only one who understands and appreciates Jughead’s love of food.
> - **Veronica**: The mean girl that Archie likes.
> - **Betty**: The nice girl that Archie likes.
> - **Reggie**: A bully.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Character Tip #5: Use Status***
> 
> Whenever people meet or interact, there is a hidden negotiation that constantly takes place. We are mostly not conscious of it, since it predates our ability to speak. It is our negotiation of status; that is, who is in charge of the current interaction? Status is not a matter of who you are; status is something you do.
> 
> ...
> 
> Any time two or more people interact in any setting—whether friends or enemies, collaborators or competitors, masters or servants—a negotiation of status takes place. We do this almost entirely subconsciously with posture, tone of voice, eye contact, and dozens of other detailed behaviors. What is surprising is how consistent these behaviors are across all cultures.
> - **Typical low-status behaviors include** fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, touching one’s own face, and generally being tense.
> - **Typical high-status behaviors include** being relaxed and in control, making strong eye contact, and, weirdly, not moving your head while you speak.
> 
> ...
> 
> Status is a largely unexplored area in interactive entertainment. ... Right now, most videogame characters behave the same way no matter who is around. It seems likely that the next generation of interactive game characters will seem more alive because they are aware of status.
> 
> 
> ***Character Tip #6: Use the Power of the Voice***
> 
> The human voice is an incredibly powerful thing, which can affect us at a deep subconscious level. This is why talking pictures elevated the cinema from a novelty to the dominant art form of the twentieth century.
> 
> ***Character Tip #7: Use the Power of the Face***
> 
> A huge percentage of our brains is taken up with custom hardware for processing facial expression. We have the most complex and expressive faces in the entire animal kingdom. Notice, for example, our eye whites—other animals do not have visible eye whites. It would appear we evolved them as a method of communication. We are also the only animal that blushes and the only animal that cries.
> 
> ...
> 
> Facial animation doesn’t have to be expensive—you can get tremendous power out of simple animated eyebrows or eye shapes.
> 
> ***Character Tip #8: Powerful Stories Transform Characters***
> 
> One distinguishing feature of great stories is how their characters change. Video game designers seldom consider this, to their detriment. There is a tendency to treat game characters as fixed types—the villain is always the villain, the hero was born a hero. This makes for very boring storytelling.
> 
> ...
> 
> It is certainly true that meaningful character change is not possible for the main character in every game. But perhaps character change can happen to other characters in the game such as the sidekick or the villain.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Character Tip #9: Let Your Characters Surprise Us***
> 
> This advice seems completely contrary to everything we know about storytelling and acting. We expect characters to behave realistically and believably. But here, Fitzgerald is telling us that in a good story, the characters do the opposite of what the audience expects. And it is totally true. When you know to look for it, you can see it everywhere. It’s in comedies, dramas, the classics, everywhere. The popular television show _Breaking Bad_ was practically founded on this principle. It’s yet another use for The Lens of Surprise. When characters have an emotional reaction that isn’t what we expect, we pay attention. And of course, fun is just pleasure with surprises, right? If you want players to enjoy playing with your characters, design each one the same way you would design a toy. Look for ways to let your characters surprise your players, and the players will hang on your characters’ every word and action.
> 
> ***Character Tip #10: Avoid the Uncanny Valley***
> 
> Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori noted something interesting about human response to robots and other artificial characters. If you think about how people empathize, you might notice that the closer something is to seeming human, the more they can empathize with it. You might even lay this out on a graph like:
> 
> ![Empathy vs Human-likeness Chart](/.attachments/empathy.human-likeness.png)
> 
> And this makes perfect sense. The more something is like a person, the more empathy we give it. But Mori noted an interesting exception, as he worked on robots that tried to mimic humans—as soon as they started to get too human, perhaps moving from a metal face (think C-3PO) to one with artificial skin, people suddenly found them repulsive.
> 
> ![Uncanny Valley](/.attachments/uncanny.valley.png)
> 
> Mori referred to this surprising dip in the curve as “the uncanny valley.” The cause of this uneasy feeling may be that when we see things that almost look like people, our brains register them as “diseased people” who might be dangerous to be around. Zombies are a canonical example of the creepy things that live at the bottom of the uncanny valley.
> 
> The uncanny valley shows up in videogames and animation all the time. Every frame of films such as _Final Fantasy_ and _The Polar Express_ looks gorgeous and natural—when you just look at one frame. But when the films are in motion, there is something about the computer-generated humans that many people find creepy—somehow, they don’t move quite right—they got too close to the valley and fell in. Contrast those characters to the cartoony characters (fish, toys, cars, robots) in Pixar films that have no problem generating empathy, because they stay to the left side of the valley, where that puppy dog is.
> 
> Videogame characters can easily have the same problems—especially in games that try to mimic reality. The day may come where videogame characters are so human looking that they can safely exist on the right side of the valley, but until then, use caution—it’s a long way down.
>
> Characters definitely make a world more interesting, but for it to be a world at all, it needs something else—a space to exist.

## Chapter 21. Worlds Contain Spaces

> ... here are five common ways that designers organize their game spaces.
> 
> 1. **Linear**: A surprising number of games are arranged on a linear game space where a player can only move forward and (maybe) back along a line. Sometimes the line has two ends; other times, it loops back on itself.
> 
> 2. **Grid**: Arranging your game space on a grid has a lot of advantages. It can be easy for players to understand, it makes it easier to ensure that things line up, it keeps things in proper proportion, and of course, grids are very easy for computers to understand. Your grid need not be a grid of squares—it can also be of ­rectangles, hexagons (popular in war games), or even triangles.
> 
> 3. **Web**: A web arrangement is achieved by marking several points on a map and connecting them with paths. This is useful when you have several places you want players to visit but you want to give them a number of different ways to get to them. Sometimes there is meaningful travel along the paths, but other times, travel is instantaneous. Some examples of web-based game spaces are as follows:
>    1. Fox and Geese
>    2. Trivial Pursuit
>    3. Zork
>    4. Club Penguin
>    5. Puzzle Quest
> 
> 4. **Points in space**: This somewhat uncommon type of game space is usually for games that want to evoke something like wandering a desert and occasionally returning to an oasis, like one does in an RPG. It also is common for games where players get to define the game space themselves. Some examples of this kind of spatial organization are the following:
>    1. Bocce
>    2. Animal Crossing
>    3. Final Fantasy
> 
> 5. **Divided space**: This kind of space is most like a real map and is common in games that are trying to replicate a real map. It is achieved by carving the space up into sections in an irregular way. Some examples of games that have divided space are as follows:
>    1. Risk
>    2. Axis and Allies
>    3. Dark Tower
> 
> ...
> 
> One very important thing to consider whenever you organize a space: What are the landmarks? The very first text adventure game, _Colossal Cave_, had two different mazes. In one, every area was described as “You are in a maze of twisty passages, all alike.” Just as confusing though was the opposite maze, in which every area was described as “You are in a maze of twisty passages, all different.” For it is certainly true that too much chaos is just as monotonous as too much order. Players of _Colossal Cave_ learned to drop items in the mazes, forming landmarks that helped them find their way. Any good game space has built-in landmarks, which help the players find where they are going and also make the space interesting to look at. Landmarks are what players remember and what they talk about, for they are what make a space memorable.
> 
> ...
> 
> Alexander notes that things that have the nameless quality usually have these aspects:
> 
> - They feel **alive**, as if they hold energy.
> - They feel **whole**, like nothing is missing.
> - They feel **comfortable**; it is pleasing to be around them.
> - They feel **free**, not constrained unnaturally.
> - They feel **exact**, as if they are just how they are supposed to be.
> - They feel **egoless**, connected to the universe.
> - They feel **eternal**, as if they have always been and always will be.
> - They are **free from inner contradictions**.
> 
The last of those, “free from inner contradictions,” is tremendously important to any designer, because inner contradictions are at the heart of any bad design. If a device is supposed to make my life easier, and it is hard to use, that is a contradiction. If something is supposed to be fun, and it is boring or frustrating, that is a contradiction. A good designer must carefully remove inner contradictions, and not get used to them, or make excuses for them—so let’s add a tool to our toolbox for removing them.

## Chapter 22. Some Interfaces Create a Feeling of Presence

> Every simulation is a kind of new reality. It is worth thinking about some of the many kinds of reality that we can create:
> - Logical Reality defines the rules of cause and effect.
> - Spatial Reality defines how I move through space.
> - Proprioceptive Reality defines where it feels like my body is.
> - Social Reality defines how I interact with others.
> 
> ...
> 
> Unfortunately, presence does not come for free with these technologies. Presence is a fragile illusion, a magician’s trick where one awkward interaction can spoil the whole effect. If you are going to design an experience centered on a feeling of presence, you must consider the disturbing notion that presence might be even more important than gameplay. ... But if the presence is broken or interrupted, the player becomes very aware that they are in a headset, and may even become annoyed by the whole experience, no matter how good the gameplay actually is. ... Those who spend time working in these new media come to realize how fragile an illusion presence really is, and how much effort must be expended to preserve it. To that end, here are six of the greatest dangers to the ­feeling of presence.
> 
> ***Presence Breaker #1: Motion Sickness***
> 
> When you think about it, the phenomenon of motion sickness is incredibly strange. A person is confronted with unusual motion (say, that of a boat, car, or roller coaster), or the appearance of motion (say, an IMAX movie, or a VR car race), and their body responds by becoming gradually more nauseous, and possibly, ultimately vomiting.
> 
> ...
> 
> Exactly what triggers motion sickness differs vastly from person to person, but it is possible to create great experiences with no “motion discomfort” by ­following these tips.
> 
> 1. **Keep the framerate up**. Consider 60 frames per second (fps) your new absolute acceptable minimum. 90 fps or more should be your goal.
> 
> 2. **Avoid virtual camera movement**. I know. You want to make a first person shooter, you want to make a racing game, you want to have a dogfight in space. All of these require a virtual camera that whizzes all over the place while the real camera (the player’s eye) stays still. Well, guess what? Any time you create a disconnect between the eye and those little hairs in the inner ear, your player can become nauseated.
> 
> 3. **If you must move the camera, don’t accelerate**. Funny thing about those little hairs in your ears—they can only detect acceleration, not velocity. They can’t tell the difference between zipping down the highway at 80 miles per hour, and sitting perfectly still. What they notice is speeding up and slowing down.
> 
> 4. **Hide the edges**. Have you ever been sitting on a bus or train, and suddenly had a feeling of motion, only to look up and realize that your vehicle is not moving at all, but rather the one next to you is? The reason for this sensation of motion is that our brain uses the edges of our visual field to decide how we are moving. Clever VR developers have realized that if they hide the edges of the visual field with what is commonly called a “vignette” they can significantly reduce feelings of motion discomfort.
> 
> 5. **Teleport sparingly**. Since virtual motion can cause motion sickness, an obvious choice of travel is teleportation—it gets you there quickly, and causes no motion sickness—perfect, right? Unfortunately, no. Surprisingly, teleportation can be a significant presence breaker. It seems the way your mind creates the illusion of presence is by building a mental 3D model of the space around you. But it can only do this if you have looked at that space. It is a subtle thing, but each time you press that teleport button, you take yourself to place where you have no presence, and you won’t get the presence back until you spend time looking at your surroundings.
> 
> 6. **And whatever you do, keep the horizon level**. Certain kinds of motion, virtual or real, are shortcuts to trigger your motion sickness alarm circuit. Rolling the camera in a “barrel roll” style, so that the horizon does cartwheels in front of the player’s eyes, is the quickest shortcut to nausea city. So—don’t do that. The canals in your inner ear that control all this are circular and very good at detecting rotation, so, generally, you should avoid virtual rotation (where the camera rotates separately from the player’s head) of any kind. Part of what makes VR unique is that it lets players really turn around—for real! Use real rotation to let players look around an environment, and avoid virtual rotation whenever possible.
> 
> ...
> 
> ***Presence Breaker #2: Counter-Intuitive Interactions***
> 
> Of course, in any game we create, we want interactions to be clear and intuitive, but in VR, the stakes are much higher. A physical interaction that is confusing or counter-intuitive will break presence in an instant. And in VR, the importance of player interactions matching reality is much higher than in a screen-based game. For example, in a traditional adventure game, objects are often uni-taskers: screwdrivers are for unscrewing and nothing else. Knives are for cutting and nothing else. It is a sort of “key and lock” mentality. But when the phenomenon of presence takes over, and your body thinks the virtual world is real, a great deal more richness of interaction is expected. ...
> 
> ***Presence Breaker #3:***
> 
> Many players crave thrill and intense action—these are important pleasures in games. And VR is a powerful way to deliver these things. But some designers fail to realize how much more intense VR can be. We have a special nucleus in our brain that is responsible for paying attention to objects that come close to our bodies. Ask someone to put their hand near your face (it doesn’t work with your own hand), and you can feel that nucleus turn on. Traditional videogames cannot activate that nucleus, but VR and AR can. Many of our greatest fears involve bad things happening to our bodies, and VR can be used to make players feel like these things are really happening! VR can make you feel like your body is falling from a great height, like you are drowning, like bees are swarming around you, like creepy monsters are touching you. These things can be thrilling and exciting, but they can also be so overwhelming that people want to rip off the headset and stop the experience. The moment someone thinks “this is too much – I want this to stop,” you have already lost them, because their inner voice is quietly repeating, like a parent to a child, “it’s only pretend… it’s only pretend…” which means your player’s mind is actively fighting against the presence you are trying so carefully to create.
> 
> ***Presence Breaker #4: Unrealistic Audio***
> 
> If I pick up a virtual coin and hold it in my hand, turning it over to look at front and back, I might be really immersed in what I’m doing if it looks realistic. But if I then drop it, and it makes no sound, I’ll be reminded that the world is fake, and my presence is destroyed. ...
> 
> ***Presence Breaker #5: Proprioceptive Disconnect***
> 
> Proprioception is more than your sense of where your body is located, it also is your sense of how your body is positioned; your awareness that you are sitting or standing, for example, or that one foot is crossed over the other. In a screen-based videogame, our proprioceptive sense is irrelevant. In VR, making our real and virtual bodies match is key to maintaining presence. If you are seated while playing a VR game that involves your character walking about a room, your body perceives it as fake, and presence is broken. The scale alone is confusing to your body: if your physical body is seated, but your virtual head is six feet off the ground, your body and mind can perceive either that you are floating, or that the world is very small, for, even though you are looking at tall adults eye to eye, your body knows that if you stood up, you’d be the equivalent of eight feet tall! Your mind knows this isn’t possible, so it can create the strange feeling that everything around you is small.
> 
> Another type of proprioceptive disconnect involves objects penetrating the player’s body—walking through a virtual table, for example. Players do not like having their bodies penetrated by virtual objects. It feels disconcerting at first, as your mind and body struggle in subconscious fear, but soon it simply breaks presence. The fastest way to bring about a proprioceptive disconnect is to give players awkward virtual bodies that they can see. If visual sense of your body differs from your proprioceptive sense (those fake hands or feet aren’t positioned where your real ones are) your mind quickly rejects the reality as fake. Much better to show no body (your brain doesn’t mind this much, for some reason) than a body slightly out of place. Consider this the uncanny valley of VR avatars.
> 
> ***Presence Breaker #6: Lack of Identity***
> 
> Presence is the pervasive sense of being somewhere. But to be somewhere you must be someone. Presence and identity are closely entwined. VR filmmakers often fail to understand this. If someone make a screen-based movie of two people talking at a table, and we watch it, it seems quite normal. We are used to screen-based media being a sort of floating eye that flits around scenes invisible to the actors. But if the same movie is filmed with VR, suddenly your body is present, and you start to wonder, “Why are these two people ignoring me? Can’t they see I’m right here?” and of course, your presence in the world immediately makes you wonder about your identity in the world. Failing to address the question of the player’s identity will be a nagging reminder to the player that they aren’t really there.
> 
> **Six Presence Builders**
> 
> While it is very important to remove all the presence breakers that you can from your experience, it is not enough. Presence doesn’t just happen. Like starting a fire with only flint and tinder, presence must be patiently fostered and encouraged. These six techniques can help.
>
> ***Presence Builder #1: Hand Presence***
> 
> Because VR and AR are technologies of the body, and not just the eyes, the way we use our bodies during these experiences is very important. And the main way that humans interact with the world is with their hands. Remember our definition of play? “Manipulation that satisfies curiosity.” The very word “manipulate” comes from the Latin word “manus,” which means hand. There is something about seeing one’s own hands that is very special. “Lucid dreaming” is the name for the unusual experience of realizing you are dreaming, yet continuing to experience your dream. This is hard for most of us, for when we realize we are dreaming, our dreams tend to quickly fade. When avid lucid dreamers realize they are dreaming, a common technique they use to stabilize the dream state is to stare at their dream hand. Something about seeing one’s own hand seems to convince the mind that the world is solid and real. ... The strongest and best hand presence occurs when the player is able to meaningfully and naturally manipulate the environment around them.
> 
> ***Presence Builder #2: Social Presence***
> 
> Humans are social creatures, and a significant amount of our brain is dedicated to processing human faces and gestures. VR and AR have the power to create a special kind of telecommunication, one that feels more natural than a screen-based video call, because of the feeling of presence of another person. Being able to speak and gesture naturally with someone else in VR and AR is a very special experience, one that will become quite common when the number of connected headsets rises over ten million. Even a simple audio phone call creates a form of presence, as you feel you are in a sort of social space with that remote person. The presence created bymaking eye contact and seeing the gestures and movements of another person in the same space with me goes a long way to making a space, and that person, seem real… and if we can hand objects back and forth, all the better.
> 
> ***Presence Builder #3: Familiarity***
> 
> Remember how we said that in order to feel presence, you must look around your environment so that your mind can build an internal 3D model of it? That is only true when you are in an unfamiliar place. If a familiar location is presented to you, such as a car interior, a fast food counter, or a basketball court, if these types of places are already familiar to you, your brain will fill out the details without you even looking, building presence quite quickly. As we’ve discussed, novelty in games is very important—but giving the right amount of familiarity, especially in your immediate surroundings, can give a feeling of presence that is surprisingly strong.
> 
> ***Presence Builder #4: Realistic Audio***
> 
> Whatever amount of sound design and integration you normally do on a game, expect to double it for a VR experience, because so much more sound design effort is required to make interactions with objects seem realistic. Partly this is because spatialized sound (the illusion that sounds are coming from a particular location) is powerful and important in VR, but also because realistic sound is very contextual. Sounds echo differently in a small room than they do in a large one. Collision sounds are especially contextual. Dropping a coin on a wooden table sounds very different than dropping it onto a glass one. In a screen-based videogame, the difference might go unnoticed—but in VR, getting these details right does a huge amount to build up presence.
> 
> ***Presence Builder #5: Proprioceptive Alignment***
> 
> Proprioceptive disconnects degrade presence, but proprioceptive alignment, where your real-life body and virtual body are strongly aligned, does a great deal to build presence. In _I Expect You To Die_, we designed the game for seated players, and so we developed seated scenarios (sitting at a desk, sitting in a car) and it did a great deal to strengthen presence. Many games have been experimenting with novel ways to give strong proprioceptive alignment, such as archery games where your arrows are stored in a quiver on your back. In order to get a new arrow, you must reach over your shoulder and grab it—a very natural and proprioceptively aligned action. As technologies improve, and foot and full-body tracking become the norm, proprioceptive alignment will be even more important, and lead to even stronger presence.
> 
> ***Presence Builder #6: Comedy***
> 
> It sounds strange, but it is much easier to build presence in a comedic world than in a serious world. ... In a cartoonish comedy world, you don’t expect everything to work right. In fact, discovering the crazy rules of the world is part of the delight! ...
> 
> ...
> 
> Giving the players reasons to look around is critical, as that helps build presence

## Chapter 23. The Look and Feel of a World Is Defined by Its Aesthetics

> One thing you should consider carefully is finding a technical artist for your team. This unusual individual has the eye of an artist and the mind of a computer programmer. A talented technical artist can build bridges between the art team and the engineering team by being able to fluently speak both of their languages and by helping to build tools that make the artists feel in command of the technology and the engineers feel in command of the art. This balance is not something to be taken lightly—when it is not right, it feels like your game is cracked down the middle, but when you achieve it, your game is gorgeous and powerful in ways your players will have never seen before.

## Chapter 24. Some Games Are Played with Other Players

> Clearly, playing with other people is natural and, in fact, the preferred way for us to play games. But why? In this book so far, we have discussed dozens of reasons people play games: for pleasure, for challenge, for judgment, for rewards, for flow, for transcendence, and many more. Although some of those are enhanced by the presence of other players, none of them require that presence. What is it that we specifically seek when playing games with other people? There seem to be five main reasons:
> 
> 1. **Competition**: When we think of multiplayer games, competition is usually the first thing that comes to mind—and for good reason. It simultaneously fills ­several kinds of needs and desires for us. All at once, it
>    1. Allows for a balanced game on a level playing field
>    2. Provides us with a worthy opponent
>    3. Gives us an interesting problem to solve
>    4. Fulfills a deep inner need to determine our skill level relative to someone else in our social circle
>    5. Allows for games involving complex strategy, choices, and psychology, all possible because of the intelligence and skill of our human opponent
>
> 2. **Collaboration**: The opposite of competition, this is the “other way” we like to play together. Collaborative games are enjoyable to us because they
>    1.	Allow us to partake in game actions and employ game strategies that are impossible with just one person (e.g., one-on-one baseball makes almost no sense)
>    2.	Let us enjoy the (presumably evolved) deep pleasures that come from group problem solving and being part of a successful team
>
> And while some people think of collaborative games as experimental, that is only the case when players are collaborating against an automated opponent. Most collaborative games follow the mold of team sports, which allow all the pleasures of collaboration and the pleasures of competition at the same time.
> 
> 3. **Meeting up**: We like to get together with our friends, but it can be socially awkward to just show up and be forced to make conversation on a regular basis. Games, like food, give us a convenient reason to be together, give us something to share, and give us something to focus on that won’t make anyone in the room uncomfortable. Games are a great way for kids and parents to spend time with each other, and many are the friendships held together by a weekly game of chess, golf, tennis, bridge, bingo, basketball, or, more recently, _League of Legends_, _Call of Duty_, or _Words with Friends_.
> 
> 4. **Exploring our friends**: And while it is great to have an excuse to meet up with our friends, games let us do something else that we can’t do so easily with just conversation—explore the minds and souls of our friends. In a conversation, we hear a friend’s opinions about likes and dislikes and their stories about the way they and other people have behaved. But these things are all filtered through the friend’s conception of what they think we want to hear. When we play a game with them, however, we get a glimpse of something more like the unvarnished truth. We get to see them solving problems. We get to see them making tough decisions under stress. We get to see them make decisions about when to cut someone a break and when to stab them in the back. We learn who we can trust and who we can’t. As Plato purportedly said, “You can learn more about a man in an hour of play than a year of conversation.”
> 
> 5. **Exploring ourselves**: Alone, games let us test the limits of our abilities, finding out what we enjoy and learning what we want to improve at. But when we are with others, we get to explore how we will behave in complex social situations, under stress. Do we have a tendency to let our friends win when they have a bad day, or to crush them unconditionally? Who do we prefer to team with, and why? How do we feel when publicly defeated, and how do we cope with that? How do our strategies differ from others, and why? Who do we choose to imitate, or find ourselves imitating? All these questions, and many others, are explored when we play games with other people. These are not trivial things—they are important things, close to the heart of how we see ourselves and how we relate to other people.

## Chapter 25. Other Players Sometimes Form Communities

> Games are something that inspires real passion in players, so it is not surprising that frequently, communities arise around games.
> 
> ...
> 
> There is a special feeling that goes with being part of a community. It is hard to describe, but we know it when we feel it. Two psychologists who set out to better understand this sense of community found that it has four primary elements:
> 
> 1. **Membership**: Something distinct makes it clear you are part of this group.
> 2. **Influence**: Being part of this group gives you power over something.
> 3. **Integration and fulfillment of needs**: Being part of this group does something for you.
> 4. **Shared emotional connection**: You have some guarantee of sharing emotions about certain events with others in the group.
> 
> ...
> 
> But why, as a game designer, do you want communities to form around your game? There are three main reasons:
> 
> 1. **Being part of a community fills a social need**: People need to feel a part of something
> 
> 2. **Longer “period of contagion”**: The personal recommendation of a friend is the most influential factor when purchasing a game. Game designer Will Wright once pointed out that if we truly believe that interest in a game spreads like a virus, it makes sense to study epidemiology. And one thing that we know from epidemiology is that when the period of contagion doubles, the number of people who catch the disease can increase by ten times. “Catching the disease” in our case means buying the game. But what does “period of contagion” for a game mean? It is the time when a player is so excited about a game that they are talking about it constantly with everyone they know. Players who become part of a game community are likely to “stay contagious” for a long time, as the game will become a deeper part of their lives, giving them a lot to talk about. Will was, as usual, ahead of the curve, as virality is now seen as a key component for success in social and mobile games.

> 3. **More hours of play**: It is often the case that players start to play a game for the game’s pleasures but stay with it over a long period for the community’s ­pleasures.

> Community is complex and involves many different interrelated psychological ­phenomena, but there are some basic things you can do to help foster a community around your game.

> ***Community Tip #1: Foster Friendships***
> 
> The idea of online friendships seems simple. Just like real friendships, but online, right? But what do we really understand about the nature of friendship? And how can we translate it to a game environment? To have a meaningful online relationship with another person requires three things:
> 
> 1. **The ability to talk**: This sounds obvious. But a surprising number of online games have been created that offer players no ability to talk to each other—the designers hoping that some kind of nonverbal communication would happen through play and that would be enough. It is not enough. For a community to form, players must be able to speak to each other freely.
> 
> 2. **Someone worth talking to**: You cannot assume that all your players will want to talk to each other, any more than you can assume that strangers on a bus will mingle. The explosion of social media has shown us that most people are mainly interested in connecting with (1) their friends and (2) celebrities. You must have a clear understanding of who your players want to talk to and why.
> 
> 3. **Something worth talking about**: The first two items could be satisfied by a good chat room. Games that foster community give the players a steady stream of things to talk about. This can come from the gameplay itself ..., depth of strategy inherent in the game (e.g., strategy discussion is a prime topic for chess communities) or from events, or rule changes that are introduced over time ...

> ***Community Tip #2: Put Conflict at the Heart***
> 
> Online game pioneer Jonathan Baron makes the point that conflict is at the heart of all communities. A sports team becomes a strong community because they have conflict with other teams. ...

> ***Community Tip #3: Use Architecture to Shape Your Community***
> 
> In some neighborhoods, people don’t really know their neighbors. In others, ­everyone knows everyone else, and the whole neighborhood has a sense of ­community. Is this because the people are different? No. It is usually a side effect of how the neighborhoods are designed. Neighborhoods that are designed to be walkable (and with meaningful destinations to walk to) give neighbors a chance to communicate. ...
> 
> ***Community Tip #4: Create Community Property***
> 
> When you can create things in your game that are not just owned by an individual player but by several, it can really encourage players to band together. Perhaps, for example, no individual player can afford to buy a ship in your game, but a group could team up and own it together. This group practically becomes an instant ­community, since they have to communicate frequently and be friendly to each other. ...

> ***Community Tip #5: Let Players Express Themselves***
> 
> Self-expression is very important in any multiplayer game. And while it is certainly true that players can express themselves through their gameplay strategies and styles of play, why stop there? You are, after all, creating a fantasy world where players can be whatever they would like to: why not let them express that? Rich, expressive avatar creation systems are much beloved by players of online games. So are systems of conversation that allow players to convey emotion or choose colors and styles for their text to display. The purchase of “vanity items” in online games is a key part of monetization ...
> 
> ***Community Tip #6: Support Three Levels***
> 
> It is important to realize that when designing a game community, you are really designing three separate games for players at different levels of experience. Some might argue there are even more, but there are at the minimum these three:
> 
> 1. **Level 1: The newbie**. Players who are new to game communities are often ­overwhelmed. They aren’t yet challenged by the game itself—they are ­challenged just by learning to play the game. In a sense, learning to play the game is the game for them—and so you are obligated to design that learning process so that it is as rewarding as possible. If you don’t, newbies will give up on the game before they really get into it, and you will significantly limit your audience. One of the best ways to make newbies feel rewarded and connected to the game is to create situations where they get to interact meaningfully with more experienced players. Some experienced players like greeting and teaching newbies for their own enjoyment, but if not enough of your players tend to do this, then why not give in-game rewards for helping newbies?

A good system to encourage experienced persons to help a novice is to use a reward system that will give them points to unlock features for a period of time.

> 2. **Level 2: The player**. The player is past the newbie stage. They completely understand the game and are immersed in the game activities and in figuring out how to master them. Most of the design that goes into the game is aimed at this group.
> 
> 3. **Level 3: The elder**. For many games, particularly for any online game involving some kind of “leveling” system, there comes a point where the game itself is no longer interesting. Most of the secrets have been discovered, and many of the game pleasures have been squeezed dry. When players reach this state, they tend to leave, seeking a new game with new secrets. Some games, however, manage to retain these elder players by giving them an entirely different game to play—one that befits their level of skill, expertise, and devotion to the game. There is tremendous benefit to keeping elders around, since they are often some of the most vocal advertisers of your game and, further, they are experts about your game, often able to teach you how to improve it. Some typical “elder games” include the following:
>    1. **A more difficult game**: Often, particularly in MMOs, the middle game is about gradual, clear progression toward a goal: when the goal is reached, then what? Sometimes a different kind of game is presented to the higher-level players, which is much more difficult—so difficult, in fact, that no one can ever consistently master it.
>    2. **Governance privileges**: Some games give the elder players special levels of responsibility, such as deciding the rules of the game.
