## Chapter 2. Defining Information Architecture

> Let’s start by clarifying what we mean by information architecture:
> 1. The structural design of shared information environments
> 2. The synthesis of organization, labeling, search, and navigation systems within digital, physical, and cross-channel ecosystems
> 3. The art and science of shaping information products and experiences to support usability, findability, and understanding
> 4. An emerging discipline and community of practice focused on bringing principles of design and architecture to the digital landscape
>
> The reason we can’t serve up a single, all-powerful, all-purpose definition is a clue to understanding why it’s so hard to design good digital products and services. We’re talking about the challenges inherent in language and representation. No document fully and accurately represents the intended meaning of its author. No label or definition totally captures the meaning of a document. And no two readers experience or understand a particular document or definition or label in quite the same way. The relationship between words and meaning is tricky at best.1 And here’s the paradox of defining information architecture: by defining and clarifying semantic concepts, IA makes them more understandable and findable, but at a cost, because definitions are so imperfect and limiting at the same time. The definition of IA itself is a great illustration of this paradox.

## Chapter 3. Design for Finding

> Information architecture is not restricted to taxonomies, search engines, and the other things that help users find stuff in an information environment. Information architecture starts with people and the reason they come to your site or use your app: they have an information need.
>
> ...
> 
> Modeling needs and behaviors forces us to ask useful questions about what kind of information users want, how much information is enough, and how they actually interact with the architecture.
> 
> ...

> But people don’t always know exactly what they want. Have you ever visited a website just to poke around? By exploring the site, you’re trying to find information of a sort; you just don’t know exactly what you’re looking for. Even when you do, you may not have the language to express it: is it “skin cancer,” or “melanoma”?
>
> ...
> 
> So back to the question: what do people want? Let’s use the metaphor of fishing to get at the answer:
>
> - _The perfect catch_. Sometimes users really are looking for the right answer. What is the population of San Marino? You go to Wikipedia or some other useful site that’s jam-packed with data, and you hook in that number (it’s 32,576, by the way, according to the latest estimate). And you’re done, just as the “too-simple” model would have it.
>
> - _Lobster trapping_. What about the times you’re looking for more than just a single answer? Let’s say you’re hoping to find out about good bed-and-breakfast inns in Stratford, Ontario. Or you want to learn something about Lewis and Clark’s journey of exploration. Or you need to get a sense of what sort of financial plans can help you save for retirement.
>
> - _Indiscriminate driftnetting_. You may be doing research for a doctoral thesis, or performing competitive intelligence analysis, or learning about the medical condition affecting a close friend, or, heck, ego surfing. In these cases, you want to catch every fish in the sea, so you cast your driftnets and drag up everything you can.
>
> - _I’ve seen you before, Moby Dick..._. There’s some information that you’d prefer to never lose track of, so you’ll tag it so you can find it again. Thanks to social bookmarking and collection services like Pinterest, it’s possible to toss a fish back in the sea with the expectation of finding it again.
> 
> This fishing metaphor is helpful because it illustrates four common information needs. When you’re hoping to make the perfect catch, you usually know what you’re looking for, what to call it, and where you’ll find it—this is called known-item seeking. An example is when you search the staff directory to find a colleague’s phone number.
>
> When you’re hoping to find a few useful items in your traps, you’re doing something called exploratory seeking. In this case, you’re not exactly sure what you’re looking for. In fact, whether you realize it or not, you’re looking to learn something from the process of searching and browsing. For example, a user may go to his employer’s human resources site to learn something about retirement plans that the company offers. In the process, he may encounter some basic information on specific types of plans, and then change his search to learning more about such plans. As he learns more about these plans, he shifts his search again to learning whether a simple or more complex plan is best for him. Exploratory seeking is typically open ended; there is no clear expectation of a “right” answer, nor does the user necessarily know how to articulate what exactly he is looking for. He is happy to retrieve a few good results, and use them as a springboard for the next iteration of the search. It’s not always possible to definitively determine when exploratory searching is finished.
> 
> When you want everything, you’re performing exhaustive research. You’re looking for everything available on a particular topic, hoping to leave no stone unturned. In this case, the user often has many ways to express what she’s looking for, and may have the patience to construct her search using all those varied terms. For example, someone who is trying to learn more about a friend’s medical condition might execute multiple searches for “AIDS,” “HIV,” “acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome,” and so forth. Again, there isn’t necessarily a “right” answer. And in this case, the user must be patient enough to wade through more results than are typical with other information needs.
> 
> Finally, our failing memories and busy schedules continually force us to engage in refinding pieces of useful information that we’ve happened upon before. For example, while you’re at work, you might surf for a few minutes and stumble on a great but long explanation of Django Reinhardt’s guitar technique. Naturally, you won’t read it now and risk losing your job. You’ll refind it later instead, or use a “read later” service such as Instapaper to return to it at a more convenient time.

> There are two other major aspects to seeking behaviors: integration and iteration. We often integrate searching, browsing, and asking in the same finding session.

> The berry-picking diagram looks messy—much more so than the “too-simple” model. It should; that’s the way our minds often work. After all, we’re not automatons.
