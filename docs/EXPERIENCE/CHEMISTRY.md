## Chapter 1. Welcome to Content Chemistry

> To be successful, websites must do two things: 1) attract visitors, and 2) convert those visitors into leads and customers. To do this, web marketers must do two things: 1) create content, and 2) promote it. Great content makes the difference between success and failure on the web.
> 
> ...
> 
> **What is Content Marketing?**
> 
> Content marketing is the art and science of pulling your audience toward your business. It is based on the concept that relevant prospects are looking for your product or service right now. If you can connect with them, help them and teach them, some of them will become loyal customers.
> 
> _Content marketers create and promote useful, relevant information with the goal of attracting and engaging website visitors, and then converting those visitors into leads and customers._
> 
> We do this by creating, publishing and promoting content that is relevant to our clients and prospects through three main channels: search engine optimization (SEO), social media and email marketing.
> 
> Content marketing is sensitive to the behaviors and psychology of potential buyers. Whether we’re looking for jet engines or consulting services, a wedding DJ or a local florist, we are all more likely than ever to look to the internet before making a decision. Every day, we search, research, read recommendations and seek advice from experts.

> In the beginning ...
> 
> Marketing was dominated by advertising, and that meant buying media. It meant _buying space_ in newspapers, hoping consumers would notice before they turned the page. It meant _buying time_ on TV, hoping consumers would keep watching when the show cut to a commercial break.
> 
> ...
> 
> Traditional advertising became less effective.
> 
> **Content Marketing vs. Advertising**
> 
> Content marketing (also known as inbound marketing) is actually nothing new. It is simply using content to connect with potential buyers and partners. The content earns the interest and trust of the audience by being entertaining or informative.

> 
> Content marketing is not only different from advertising, it’s the opposite of it. Content marketers attract their audience by being relevant. Advertisers inject themselves into other relevant media, hoping to be noticed. It’s pull versus push.
> 
> ...
> 
> In the words of marketing expert and New York Times bestselling author Jay Baer, content is the **help**. Advertising is the **hype**.
> 
> **Web Strategy and Website ROI**
> 
> Whether you’re spending your own cash or just investing your time, the return on investment in web marketing comes down to three main factors:
> 
> - Traffic (number of visitors)
> - Conversion rate (percentage of visitors taking action, becoming leads or subscribers, etc.)
> - Maintenance costs
> 
> ...
> 
> Everything a content chemist does should increase traffic and conversions while minimizing the cost and time in any way possible.
> 
> ...
> 
> Each time the site appears in a search results page is an “impression.”
> 
> ...
> 
> Two factors determine the total number of impressions: _the number of keyphrases a site ranks for and the rank for each keyphrase_.
> 
> ...
> 
> When the site ranks, it attracts an audience, and some of them will click. The percentage of searchers that click on site's listing [in an SERP (Search Engine Results Page)] is the “clickthrough rate,” or CTR. Each click is a visit.
> 
> ...
> 
> Getting traffic from search engines is great, but it’s not the same as leads. If a researcher looking for lab services finds a particular website, he’s not a lead yet. He’s just a visitor. When a visitor calls or fills out the site's contact form, he is officially a “conversion.” The better the site, the higher the “conversion rate.” There are many factors that determine the conversion rate, including design quality (brand loyalty and overall appeal), content format (text, images and video), the content itself (compelling, informative and relevant) and usability (navigation and an easy-to-use form).
> 
> ...
> 
> Now they need to convert the leads into actual customers. [Let's say that the sales team] can close around 50% of her leads. Each time they do this, they sell $1,000 worth of lab services. It costs them about $500 in time and overhead each time they provide this service. So generally speaking, the value of a lead to the company is about $500.
> 
> Now that we have all the pieces, we can put them together in a (very cumbersome but comprehensive) set of formulas for estimating the return on the investment for a marketing website.*
> 
> (Leads x Closing Rate)(Price-Time and Materials) = Profit
>
> ![Content Marketing Formulas](/.attachments/content.marketing.formulas.png)
>
> ....
> 
> Launching the site is just the beginning. There’s still is a lot of work to do, here's what is involved.
>
> - The ongoing work to get results in search engines. Search engine marketing takes time.
> - Create and promote relevant content consistently.
> - Boost traffic with a new email newsletter on a regular basis.
> - Following up on web leads and tracking them using a database.
> 
> ...
> 
> Here are the basic tools for content marketing:
> 1. Blog
> 2. Contact Form for Lead Generation
> 3. Email Service Provider (such as MailChimp)
> 4. Web Analytics
> 5. Social Media Presence

## Chapter 2. How it all Works

> ![Content Marketing Strategy Mind Map](/.attachments/content.marketing.mind.map.jpg)
> 
> **Strategy**
> 
> It all starts with a clear understanding of why you’re in business and how you deliver value to your customers.
> 
> 1. **Mission, Vision and Values**: Why are you in business? What is your core offering? What does your company stand for? Know these first, or you’re building your marketing on sand.
> 
> 2. **Research: Audience Needs, Market Size, Competitive Analysis**: Know your niche. How do you meet the demands of your audience? What is your place in the market? Are you up against big, consolidated competitors? Or are you in a fragmented market? _Content strategy is the bait to use, but audience strategy is the pond to fish in_.
> 
> **Branding**
> 
> Now you can create the perception you will project into the market. Branding is the perception of your position in the market, including all your content and imagery. It should be consistent from the first impression throughout the entire experience of each of your visitors and customers.
> 
> 3. **Position**: Now you can get specific about your target audience and their unmet needs. What is your unique point of difference? Use a positioning template to guide you through the positioning thought process.
> 
>    If you haven’t created your positioning statement yet, there’s a template for you in the Lab section.
>
> 4. **Messaging**: How can you best describe the value you provide? What evidence do you have to support your unique point of difference? Align your message with your position and your values. Find a clear and concise voice.
> 
> 5. **Visual Standards**: Create a visual continuity through colors, styles and type. Carry this through your website, your offline materials, your social networks, your email marketing and each piece of your content.
> 
> **Web Design**
> 
> ...
> 
> 7. **Keyword Research**: People are looking for you right now. If you find out what they’re searching for, you can align pages on the website with phrases that they’re searching for. Make sure to research keywords before you make the sitemap.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10. **Moodboards**: If the wireframes are about structure, the moodboards are about style. Here’s where the visual standards are executed online. Moodboards set background colors, button styles and type treatments for headers, links and body text.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Website Content**
> 
> You’ll create the website content during the web design process. Once the sitemap is final, the full scope of the content requirements is set. Finalize the initial content for the main marketing pages before development is complete, or it will delay the launch.
> 
> 14. **Strategy**: What questions does your audience have? What concerns? What do they desire, fear, trust and love? The website content topics and tone must align with the people who will be reading it. Create personas if necessary.
> 
> 15. **Write**: Write with these readers in mind [Buyer Personas]. Respect the time of the readers and be concise. Think ahead about traffic and use the target phrases. Pay close attention to formatting and internal linking. Select images and create videos that build credibility. Put your best foot forward, but be humble.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Create Content**
> 
> A website without a steady stream of useful content is just an online brochure. _It has no pulse_. It is simply an online advertisement. But add useful content and suddenly, there’s a bigger reason to visit. There’s a reason to share, to link and to open the newsletters. Content generates the trust that generates the fans, the leads and the sales.
> 
> 19. **Content Marketing Strategy**: A sustainable content marketing plan is based on the resources available: people, money and time, both internally and from vendors and partners. An effective content marketing plan is based on topics, tone and frequency that align with the needs of the audience. Personas and publishing calendars will help.
> 
> ...
> 
> 20. **Research**: A carefully researched article is more useful to your audience than an opinion piece. Visitors are more likely to search for, share, bookmark and read thorough “how-to” posts. Do your research and create something valuable. Surveys and original research with evidence are among the highest-value content on the web.
> 
> 21. **Create**: Write the posts, record the podcasts or shoot the videos—whichever _format_ is best for your audience. Use a ghostwriter, content template, content checklist or restaurant napkin—whichever _method_ is best for you and your team.
> 
> 22. **Curate**: Repurpose content from other sources, but add your own insights and perspective. Interviews, event recaps and article round-ups are all efficient ways to produce high-value content quickly.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Content Promotion**
> 
> Now we’re ready to promote our content. It’s not enough to just publish. Our focus here is content marketing, not advertising. That means making your content visible through search engine optimization, social media and email marketing. It’s time to market your marketing.
> 
> **Search Engine Optimization**
> 
> Ranking in search engines can provide a durable, consistent source of traffic. It requires research, careful writing, and a credible website and domain. This means enough link popularity to compete for the phrases you’re targeting.
> 
> 25. **Keyword Research**: As with web page content, blog posts and other content marketing should be aligned with keyphrases. As before, select keyphrases based on search volume, competition and relevance. ...
> 
> 26. **Guest Blogging**: Your content shouldn’t be limited to your own site. Writing high-quality content and submitting it to relevant blogs is good for branding and SEO. It’s a way to put your message in front of a new audience and make new friends.
>
> 27. **Search-Savvy PR**: Public relations activity can also create great linking opportunities. PR professionals who know the value of links take advantage of any media attention to seek authoritative links to specific web pages and blog posts.
> 
> 28. **Other Marketing Activity**: Of course, this goes beyond search optimization, but it’s worth noting that all kinds of offline marketing have potential search benefits. Events, partnerships, advertising, association memberships and sponsorships can all create link opportunities.
> 
> **Social Media**
>
> Social media marketing is a powerful channel for promoting content and an indispensable tool for online networking. Both of these outcomes are important for lead generation. Great social media marketing includes content promotion, content curation and one-to-one conversation.
> 
> 29. **Research**: Find specific people to connect with, such as prospects, bloggers, journalists, editors and influencers. Build lists of people to watch. Carefully research publications and blogs before pitching content.
> 
> 30. **Pitch**: For both PR and guest blogging, pitching content goes handin-hand with social media. Use social channels to build stronger connections gradually. Submit content with humility and sensitivity to the audience of the blog or publication. Always be thoughtful of editors’ time.
> 
> 31. **Social Sharing**: Post your content on the social networks where your audience spends time. Don’t be shy. Believe in your content and share each post multiple times over days, weeks and months. Deliberately share the post with people who will love what you wrote on social media and even with personal emails.
> 
> 32. **Conversation**: Don’t let your social stream fill up with promotional posts. Talk to people! Use social media as a tool for networking. When possible, move the conversation from casual mentions on Twitter to email, phone and face-to-face meetings.
> 
> **Email Marketing**
>
> Search engines and social networks are all owned by companies—but your email list belongs to you and your business. An engaged list of subscribers who look forward to your content is one of the most powerful tools for nurturing and generating leads.
> 
> 33. **Design and Production**: Your email template should be lightweight, mobile-friendly and easy to manage. Your subject line should be descriptive but leave room for curiosity. You should craft your teaser text and call to action to maximize clickthroughs.
> 
> 34. **Timing and Frequency**: When is your audience most likely to open? Friday at lunch or Saturday morning? How often should you send email? If your sales cycle is long, you may only need to send something monthly. Focus on quality, not quantity. Grow your audience by politely inviting your current prospects to join your list.
> 
> 35. **Testing**: Email marketing is easy to track, so each email is an opportunity for measurement and improvement. Use A/B test subject lines and experiment with timing. Add tracking codes using the Google URL Builder to compare campaigns. Keep experimenting and improving.
>
> ...
> 
> **Analytics**
> 
> Analytics is a decision support tool. Use it to do real analysis and check the results of experiments. The two most important numbers for lead generation are total traffic and conversion rate. Focus all your efforts on these two numbers.
> 
> 37. **Visitors and Overall Traffic Levels**: Adjusting for seasonality, is traffic up or down? Is your content attracting more visitors over time? Are the visitors bouncing after one page or going deeper into your website?
> 
> 38. **Traffic Sources**: Where are visitors coming from? Which of your promotion channels are effective? Which keyphrases, email campaigns and social channels are pulling in visitors?
> 
> 39. **Content Performance**: Which pages are connecting with visitors? Which topics are getting traction? Which are most successful at generating traffic and conversions?
> 
> 40. **Conversions**: The bottom line is the total number of leads or ecommerce sales. The total traffic times your conversion rate equals success. Other conversions include newsletter subscribers, job applicants and event registrants. Social follows are also conversions, but they don’t appear in Analytics.

## Chapter 3. Traffic Sources

> ...
> 
> As a content marketer, you must plan to generate traffic _through activity_. Let’s recategorize the traffic sources to align them with our three main content marketing techniques: search engine optimization, social media and email marketing.
> 
> **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**
> 
> ...
> 
> Ultimately, all SEO efforts have one focus: **to indicate that your site is relevant**. Every time you see or hear the phrase “search engine optimization,” substitute the words “indicating relevance” and you’ll have the right mindset for good SEO work.
> 
> Your goal is simply to help Google help people find you. Cooperate with Google and stay on its good side. The key to SEO is to have valuable content and confirm this to Google with great links from relevant sites.
>
> ...
> 
> According to Advanced Web Rankings’ ongoing tracking of clickthrough rates by search position, the first three spots in Google get almost 54% of all clicks. The top spot gets 26%, second place gets 17% and so on down the line. The numbers are even higher when the search term includes a brand name. Everyone knows that page two is no-man’s land, but not everyone realizes that ranking first drives six times as much traffic as ranking fifth.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Authority (link popularity)**: Are there many links to your website? Are the links from sites with high authority themselves?
> 
> **Relevance (on-page keyword usage)**: Is the keyword used on the page? Is the page relevant for the broader topic?
> 
> **Other page aspects**: Content length, load time, structured markup, etc.
>
> **User signals**: Are visitors clicking through from search results? Are they spending long or short periods of time on the page?
> 
> **Domain name**: Is the domain a popular brand? Is the keyword on the domain name?
> 
> **Social activity**: Quantity and quality of social media shares and mentions of the page.
> 
> Suddenly it’s clear that links on other people’s websites are a big factor in how high you rank in search engines. If you’re serious about SEO, getting good links has to be part of your content marketing efforts ...
>
> ..
> 
> Now that we have a general idea of how search engines work, let’s introduce the three key SEO-related activities that a content marketer should focus on:
> - Keyphrase research
> - On-page search optimization
> - Link popularity
> 
> ...
> 
> As a content marketer, you must carefully choose phrases that meet three criteria:
> 
> - **Search volume**: How many people are searching for this phrase?
> - **Competition**: How many websites are relevant for this phrase? Are they powerful sites?
> - **Relevance**: If someone found your site while searching for this phrase, would they be happy? Would you be happy they found you?
> 
> ...
> 
> Here’s a list of the most important places to use your target phrase to help Google understand that you are relevant. They are listed in order of importance.
>
> - **Title**: Between `<title>` and `</title>`.
> - **Headers**: Between `<h1>` and `</h1>` as well as `<h2>` and so on.
> - **Body text**: This is all the text on the page that isn’t within links.
> - **Meta description**: Although it doesn’t actually appear on the web page, the meta description often appears in search results as the snippet.
>
> ...
> 
> Think about it: if 1,000 websites link to a page about the U-505 submarine and each of those 1,000 links have text such as “learn more about the U-505 submarine,” then the page must be relevant for that topic. The links are a powerful indicator of relevance. This is especially true if those 1,000 sites are also about submarines and those sites have many inbound links themselves.
> 
> This is why link popularity is an excellent way for search engines to see what sites are really about. As we saw from the Moz research above, link popularity is a heavily weighted ranking factor. Why? Because it’s hard to fake. If SEO was only about which page uses the phrase most often, anyone could put “U-505 submarine” on the page a hundred times and rank high. Google would then be full of spam. This is why links matter so much.
> 
> ...
> 
> The best links are from sites that have a high link popularity themselves. These links are worth more. Just like a popularity contest, one vote from someone popular is worth more than a dozen votes from the unknown.
> 
> ...
> 
> Links from related sites are generally better. A link from a completely irrelevant site is not as valuable, since that site doesn’t have as much credibility on that topic.
> 
> ...
> 
> Now that you understand link popularity, consider your target keyword. The likelihood of ranking for that phrase depends on the competition.
> 
> Do the high-ranking sites for the keyword have higher link popularity than you? Then choose another keyword.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lots of times, link text is simply “click here” or “www.example.com.” But when link text includes a keyword, it can be another indication of relevance. If the links to a page say “flying carpet safety,” then Google is likely to believe that this is what the page is about.
> 
> ...
> 
> When too many links to a page include the target keyword, it may look spammy. Google may penalize you for “over-optimization.”
>
> Don’t try too hard to get links with your exact keyword as link text. It looks unnatural. Balance is good.
> 
> ... Website owners can tell Google not to follow certain links by adding a tiny code that says “nofollow.” Google skips these links, which then have much less value (if any) to the website on the other end. Today, most popular blogs have links within comments set to “nofollow,” so blog commenting is not considered an important SEO tactic.
>
> ...
> 
> There are actually two types of relevance and two types of keyphrases. They attract two different types of visitors. _Understanding this is key to content marketing_.
> 
> ...
> 
> The keyphrase indicates the visitors’ intent. There are two types of keyphrases: question marks and dollar signs.
> 
> ... If you want a lot of leads, you have to help a lot of researchers.
> 
> ...
> 
> _“Companies have to create content that transcends the transaction-—content only about your products and services is called a brochure.”_
> 
> - Sites without content marketing are truly just ads. They’re known as brochure-ware websites. They don’t have pages that teach, help, inspire or entertain. They don’t target the broader set of phrases. They don’t attract a larger audience.
> 
> - Sites that do publish search optimized educational content often attract huge audiences. The goal of the content marketer is the unlock the expert knowledge within their organization and offer it to the world, growing attention and, ultimately, demand.
> 
> Build a mini-version of Wikipedia for your industry.
> 
> ...
> 
> In the end, ranking in search engines and indicating your relevance comes down to great content written by a credible author and supported by great links. In other words, if you want to rank high, be good. Build and maintain a great online presence. If you are the best site on the Internet for that topic, Google will try hard to help people find you.
> 
> Target good keyphrases, use them in appropriate ways and look for opportunities to get high-quality links to your site. But above all, _strive to be truly relevant_.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Social Media Marketing**
> 
> Traffic from social media is the direct result of activity. Unlike traffic from search engines, where one page may rank well for years, social media requires ongoing work. If you stop promoting content on social media, traffic from social networks will naturally drop. This is because social streams move fast. Most of the clicks, shares and interactions happen within hours or minutes of posting your article.
> 
> But it’s very hard to predict what people will share or click. Who knows what’s going to go viral tomorrow? People may love a post on one network, but ignore it on another. Last week, everyone liked that post. But today, it was mostly ignored. Social traffic is notorious for spikes and troughs, peaks and valleys.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Social media is a powerful, efficient way to connect with the people who have already built the audience you’re targeting.
> 
> Our goal is to connect with people who have already built the audience you need to reach… Then borrow that audience in a sensitive and considerate way.
> 
> There are names for this kind of work: online networking, influencer marketing, blogger relations or just digital PR.
> 
> ...
> 
> So who creates content? Who can we connect with that might mention, link and share their authority?
> 
> - Journalists
> - Authors
> - Podcasters
> - Academic Researchers
> - Event Producers
> - Bloggers and Blog Editors
> 
> ![How Relationships Affect Lead Generation](/.attachments/lead-generation-social.media.jpg)
> 
> ...
> 
> Promoting your own content is only one type of social media post. If that’s the only thing you share, you’re missing out on the networking benefits, and your account won’t be a lot of fun to follow. You’re using social as a dumping ground for links.
> 
> Really, there are three types of social media posts. (Fig. 4e)
> 
> - ⅓ of your posts are your own content, driving traffic to your website.
> - ⅓ of your posts are news, ideas and advice from other people in your industry, shared partly to help your audience and partly to build relationships with those influencers.
> - ⅓ of your posts are personal interactions, saying thank you, asking / answering questions and talking to people directly, with influencers as well as customers, strangers, friends and anyone else!
> 
> ![Social Media vs Online Networking](/.attachments/social.media-vs-online.networking.jpg)
> 
> ![Social Media Network Comparison Chart](/.attachments/social.media.posts.share.jpg)
> 
> Together, these types of posts combine to drive traffic, build a brand, grow a personal network and, eventually, drive rank and revenue.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Email Marketing**
> 
> Although it may now seem like traditional digital marketing, email marketing is a powerful traffic generator. We don’t know any serious content marketers who don’t use email marketing.
> 
> ...
> 
> Ethical email marketers keep the following principles in mind:
> 
> - List growth
> - List cleanliness
> - Email timing
> - Subject lines
> - Content and calls to action
> - Testing and reporting
>
> ...
> 
> The long-term goal of email marketing is to always measure results and continually improve. But unless you add special tracking code, the traffic from your email campaigns will be mixed together with all your other traffic in Google Analytics, making it harder to measure what people are doing after they arrive.
> 
> To make the traffic from email appear separately in Google Analytics, use the Google URL Builder. Put each link from your email into this tool, then add the three main parameters into the form: Campaign Source, Campaign Medium and Campaign Name.

## Chapter 4. Conversions

> All visitors—all of us—want our problems solved and our desires fulfilled. Maybe we were thinking of the problem or the desire when we came to the site, or maybe not. Either way, _visitors convert into customers when the hope for a solution is stronger than the fear that they’ll be disappointed_.
>
> So there are two factors at work: One is pulling them toward conversion, and the other is friction that is pushing them away.
> 
> If the motivation is stronger than the friction, the visitor converts, meeting their goals and yours.
> 
> ![Motivation vs Friction](/.attachments/user.motivation-vs-friction.jpg)
> 
> Generating leads and sales is the ultimate goal of most websites, but there are many types of conversions, and all of them are good. The smaller successes are important steps toward turning visitors into fans and fans into customers.
> 
> ...
> 
> Many factors determine the percentage of visitors that convert.
> 
> **Relevance and traffic source**: Is the website relevant to the visitor you attracted? How targeted is the website traffic? For example, visitors from social media are generally less likely to buy something or become a lead than visitors from search engines, because they typically don’t have strong intent..
> **Overall design appeal of the site**: Does the site look professional? Credible?
> **Clarity**: Is the main message of the website clear? Is it obvious what the company does? Or is the main message general and vague, such as “world class service”?
> 
> ...
> 
> ---
>
> :bulb: **The 5-Second Test** To confirm that the site is communicating quickly and clearly, show it to someone who isn’t familiar with the brand. Don’t prepare them. Just say “I want to show you something” and pull up the site. After five seconds, turn off the screen. Now ask them. “What does this company do?” If they can’t tell you, the site has failed the test. When you ask the person what they remember about the site, you’ll learn which elements are the most visually prominent. Any surprises?
>
> ---
> 
> If the site doesn’t pass the 5-Second Test, expect a low conversion rate.
> 
> - **Descriptive navigation**: Do the labels of the links and buttons help the visitor accurately predict what they’ll find when they click? Are they explicit? Or are they generic, such as “services”?
> 
> - **Provides key information**: Does the website answer the visitors’ most important questions? Does it address common objections?
>
> - **Simple words**: Does the site use simple, easy-to-understand language? Or does it use fancy jargon that some visitors may not quickly grasp?
> 
> - **Content format**: Is the content presented in a visual, compelling format, such as images and video? Is the textbased content legible and formatted for easy scanning and reading?
> 
> - **Trust and evidence**: Does the content include evidence of legitimacy? Do other people trust this brand? To increase trust, add “social proof” and other evidence, such as prominent testimonials, client logos, positive reviews, press mentions, industry credentials, association memberships, number of customers and years in business.
> 
> ![The Definitive Guide to Lead Generation](/.attachments/form.length-vs-conversion.rate.jpg)
> 
> ..
> 
> - **Obvious calls to action**: Does the site offer easy-to-find calls to action? Do the imagery and colors guide the visitors’ attention to the desired actions? Are there other distractions that pull attention away from the conversion buttons?
> 
> - **Urgency**: Does the site trigger “loss aversion” and remind visitors that they may risk, miss or lose something by not acting quickly?
>
> - **Short, easy forms**: Are the forms short and easy to complete? Or are they greedy, asking more questions than the visitor feels are necessary?
> 
> A site that aligns well with these elements will convert a higher percentage of visitors. Our goal is to add clarity, trust and relevance, while removing distraction, confusion and annoyance. Studies show that shorter forms convert at a higher rate.
> 
> ---
>
> :bulb: Typically, an overall conversion rate of 3% or more is considered high. If the conversion rate is 1% or lower, something is probably wrong.
> 
> ---
> 
> The better you understand your target audience, the more likely you are to create an online experience that converts well. When possible, create personas, send surveys or do focus group testing. If nothing else, talk to the sales and customer service teams to learn what questions, concerns and objections your potential customers have.
> 
> If you can discover the things that pique visitors’ interest; create urgency; and address any fears, uncertainties and doubts, it’s easier to create a website and develop content that speaks to visitors directly. This is great for your conversion rate.
> 
> 
> ---
>
> :bulb: Create content that addresses the questions and concerns that are specific to various stages in the buying process and the conversion funnel.
> 
> ---
> 
> There is an inverse correlation between the length of a form and the percentage of visitors who fill it out and submit. Studies show that shorter forms convert at a higher rate.
> 
> Resist the temptation to create a “warmer lead” by asking for too much information. Long forms are considered “greedy.” Often, you can gather the information you’re looking for when you follow up on the lead offline. For lead generation forms, include and require the minimum number of fields: name, phone number, email, and possibly company name and message.

> In our experience designing and building websites at Orbit Media, we have found that the subsequent page after a first conversion is an excellent place to let the visitor take action again. If visitors had enough interest and trust to take action once, they may take action twice if offered the opportunity on the thank you page.
> 
> The trick is to first give visitors what they want. For example, many ecommerce shopping carts ask visitors to create an account before checking out. This isn’t what the visitors were hoping for. They clicked “buy now,” not “buy after I give you my email address and password.”
> 
> In the Analytics accounts of our clients, we’ve seen the lack of a “guest checkout” option reduces sales by 30-50%. Requiring visitors to create accounts first is simply greed for more information on the part of a self-centered website owner. This is counter to the principles of content marketing. First, we give visitors what they want. Then, they may give us what we want.
> 
> On one website, we added the option to create an account after the checkout process. We included two simple sentences of benefit copy: “We’ll remember your address for a faster checkout next time. We’ll also store your order history and let you create a wishlist.” The percentage of shoppers who created accounts increased by 40%.

> 
> “Enter email address” next to a subscribe button isn’t exactly a great pitch for your newsletter. On the other hand, if you include the right message next to that signup box, you may see a higher conversion rate for subscribers.
> 
> - **State the topic**: If the visitor can’t tell what the newsletter is going to be about, you aren’t conveying the value of subscribing.
> 
> - **Indicate frequency**: If the visitor can’t tell how often the newsletter is coming, they may hesitate to subscribe.
> 
> - **Social proof**: Show the number of subscribers or a testimonial to indicate that others appreciate the content.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... the percentage of website visitors who take action is called the conversion rate. Set up rates for each possible conversion on any website as separate goals within Google Analytics. This will allow you to measure the success of each, and then optimize the site to convert better. This is called conversion rate optimization (CRO).
> 
> ---
> 
> :bulb: Although form submissions are the main type of conversions, you can set up Google Analytics to measure other actions as goal completions, including time spent on the website, number of pages viewed and PDF downloads.
> 
> ---
> 
> To optimize the site for conversions, you need to see where any problems are and what needs to be fine-tuned. To help you see what’s happening on and around the conversion pages, Analytics has a report called “funnel visualization.”[^1]
> 
> ![Funnel Visualization](/.attachments/google.analytics.funnel.visualization.jpg)
> 
> ...
> 
> Now that you can see this activity, you can look for ways to improve the site to make it more compelling and easier to use. If the number is low, ask yourself the following questions:
> 
> - Did the site answer enough of visitors’ initial questions?
> 
>   Talk to the sales team to learn the most common questions and objections. Add content that answers top questions and addresses top concerns.
>
> - Did the site connect with visitors as people?
> 
>   The site should connect on a human level, through pictures of the team, videos from company leadership, photos of your offices, etc.
> 
> - Does the site convey trust?
> 
>   If not, add third-party credentials, badges for certifications, association memberships, testimonials, case studies, security information (ecommerce) and content that demonstrates experience and expertise.
> 
> - Is the site easy to use?
> 
>   Make sure the forms are short, and name pages and sections properly. Any tiny bit of confusion between the website and the visitor is friction. The site should guide visitors effortlessly through the series of pages that teaches them, helps them and gently offers to let them take action.
> 
> - Is the content compelling?
> 
>   All the text and video on the top pages must be concise and compelling. When visitors leave the contact form and go to other pages, they’re giving you another chance.
> 
> Two numbers determine your results: traffic and conversions. Traffic times the conversion rate equals leads and revenue. Now that you have a balanced view of both halves of the equation, you can approach web marketing more efficiently. Always try to diagnose and fix the biggest problems first and grab the lowest-hanging fruit.
> 
> ...
> 
> A great lead generation website has a specific set of pages, each with specific elements. Let’s break it down. The typical flow looks something like this.
> 
> ![Conversion Funnel](/.attachments/lead.generation.stages.pages.jpg)
> 
> The website gently leads the visitor through a series of steps: awareness, interest, trust, then action. That’s a classic “conversion funnel.” Notice how the pages align with steps in the funnel:
> 
> 1. **Blog post**: Attracts visitors with useful information (awareness)
>
>    It all starts before the visitor arrives at the website. They may come from email marketing or social media, but often, it starts with a search.
> 
>    Your audience is constantly looking for information relevant to your field, so the key is to write many helpful blog posts and align the articles with keyphrases. The articles should be so useful that the readers will be glad to have found you.
> 
>    While they’re there, they will find easy ways to get more of your helpful advice through email marketing (a prominent sign-up form), social media (icons that let them follow you) or more content (internal links to related content).
> 
> 2. **Web page**: Explains what you do (interest)
> 
>    Here’s where you begin selling. Like the blog post, the information here is helpful, but now it describes how you do the work for the prospect. The goal is to state the value you provide in simple terms, and provide evidence that you are legitimate.
> 
> 3. **About page**: Explains why you do what you do (trust)
> 
>    Visitors want to know who they might be working with. That’s why the “About” page is one of the most popular pages on every lead generation website. Here is where you put a face to the name, tell your story and explain your mission. In the words of Teddy Roosevelt, “Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.”
> 
>    Connecting the service to the people is critical, even if the organization is large and only the executives are listed here. Visitors who are interested in the service are always interested in the service provider.
> 
> 4. **Contact page**: Simple way to get in touch (action)
> 
>    The trick here is to get out of the way. It should be as effortless as possible with no distractions. Just a simple form. The idea is to start a conversation, not interrogate your visitors.
> 
> 5. **Thank you page**: They’ve completed the funnel and are now a lead (conversion)
> 
>    On many lead generation sites, this page is nothing more than two tiny words. That’s a missed opportunity. The thank you page is your first interaction with your new lead. Make it a good one by setting expectations. You’ve also got an opportunity here to create an even stronger connection.
> 
> A great blog post is the first step in the lead generation process. It should include all of the following elements.
> 
> 1. **Keyword-focused header**: Use the target keyphrase once in the `<h1>` header. Along with the `<title>`, this is one of the most important places to use the phrase.
> 
> 2. **Prominent email sign-up box with descriptive call to action**: A great email sign-up form tells people what they’re going to get and gives some evidence that it’s good.
> 
> 3. **Social media networks, but only those where you are truly active**: You don’t really want the visitor to leave your site, but if they do, send them to a network where you are truly engaged with your audience.
> 
> 4. **Compelling image or chart**: Every great post has a great image. This makes the post more attractive, both on your site and in the social streams when readers share it. This is your chance to explain concepts visually with informative charts or diagrams.
> 
> 5. **Helpful, detailed article**: It’s the deep, how-to content that positions you as the expert. These posts are more likely to rank in search engines and readers are more likely to share them. So go big. The more useful, the better.
> 
> 6. **Links to service pages and your about page**: It’s nice of you to give away your best advice, but it’s hard work, and it doesn’t necessarily generate leads. The pathway from posts to pages should be clear in the navigation.
> 
> 7. **Internal links to other blog posts and service pages**: Beyond the navigation, use internal links within your posts to guide visitors deeper into the site, both to other blog posts and to service pages.
> 
> 8. **Call to action for comments and more information**: Many visitors may get what they wanted from your super useful blog post and then leave. That’s fine, but to improve the chances that they’ll stick around, end each post with an invitation to get in touch for more information or with a question that invites a comment.
> 
> ![Blog Post Page](/.attachments/funnel.blog.post.page.jpg)
> 
> 9. **Contact link or phone number**: The top right corner is the standard place for contact information. Visitors will look for it here. Use a button to your contact page, your phone number or both.
> 
> 10. **Clear, simple description of services**: It’s best to call your services what your visitors would call them. Keep the language simple in your headers and body. Make sure to answer the questions that potential customers commonly ask. If you don’t, they may look for answers on other websites.
> 
> 11. **Evidence, examples, data and social proof**: Anyone can claim to do something, but not everyone can prove it. Add evidence of the benefits and return on investment of your services. This may include examples, statistics and research. Better yet, add social proof in the form of testimonials, using the voice of your happy customers.
> 
> 12. **Videos, demos and diagrams**: If you offer a service that requires a high degree of trust, videos are an excellent way to improve lead generation. They let the visitor see your face and hear your voice.
> 
>     If you offer a service that is difficult to explain, use diagrams and demos to explain those complex ideas.
> 
> ![Service Page](/.attachments/funnel.service.page.jpg)
> 
> 15. **Personality, values and your story**: Here you’ll answer the big questions: Why are you in this business? How long have you been doing this? What motivates your team? Why does this service matter?
> 
>     ...
>
> 16. **Testimonials, quotes and awards**: Just like the service pages, this is a good place to add evidence of legitimacy. Anything that applies to the entire business and not just one service will work. That includes awards, certifications, ratings and association memberships, as well as quotes from customers.
> 
> 17. **Simple contact form**: This is one of the best tips for optimizing a website to convert visitors into leads: Use a contact form with the minimum number of fields.
> 
>     Of course, you’ll need a lot of information to qualify them, but get it during the sales process. Don’t use a greedy form
>
> 18. **Phone number, address and directions**: Not all visitors want to become a web lead. Some want to call. Great. Put all of your contact information on this page, including a link to a map with directions. And If you have an attractive location, show a photo of it here. It helps build legitimacy
> 
> 19. **Simple contact form**: This is one of the best tips for optimizing a website to convert visitors into leads: use a contact form with the minimum number of fields. Of course, you’ll need a lot of information to qualify them, but get it during the sales process. Don’t use a greedy form.

> 
> ![About Page](/.attachments/funnel.service.about.page.jpg)
> 
> ![Contact Page](/.attachments/funnel.service.contact.page.jpg)
> 
> 21. **A genuine thank-you**: Be sincere and use a personal tone. You should also explain what happens next. How soon will you be in touch? Who will make contact?
> 
> 22. **Email sign-up box**: If they were ready to reach out, they may already really like you and your brand. Give them the option to subscribe to more of the content that impressed them the first time
> 
> 23. **Social media networks**: Even if they don’t follow you, there’s still a chance to show them your latest thinking and a bit of your personality. Just make sure they’ll find helpful, relevant posts and positive interactions in your social streams.
> 
> 24. **Links to recommended articles and additional content**: If you don’t offer other options on this page, you might as well tell people to leave the site. Why not invite them back into your site for a bit more helpful advice?
>

> ...
> 
> For the mobile-friendly version of your site, be careful where you put call to action buttons. Some parts of your page are right under the visitor’s thumb. Others are harder to reach.

## Chapter 5. Content

> Our company is where \
> **[audience X]** finds \
> **[content Y]** for \
> **[benefit Z]**.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Audience X**
> 
> Unlike the target audience for our products and services, the target audience for our content marketing may be very broad. In content marketing, as we discovered in the Lecture section, we have two target audiences and two types of visitors:
> 
> - Potential customers we hope to sell to
> - Anyone we can help through our expert advice
>
> That larger audience of people who are interested in our content can drive huge, indirect benefits. This includes a world of potential visitors, followers, subscribers and influencers. Without this second audience, we are unlikely to attract enough of that first audience to create steady demand.
> 
> **Content Y**
> 
> These are the topics and formats that we will publish. It is the overlap between the topics that we know and can teach, and the topics that our audience wants. When we share this expert knowledge, we pull our audience toward us.
> 
> Keep in mind that the types of content will go beyond the topics and include the **formats for content**, such as:
> 
> - Original research
> - Opinion pieces
> - Guest posts
> - Interviews and roundups
> - Video, audio and live events
> 
> Great content marketers publish more than an endless stream of blog posts.
> 
> **Benefit Z**
> 
> It has to be helpful. Our content will be useful, or at least entertaining. Our mission must name the specific benefits that our content offers our audience. If there is no benefit to them, we won’t win their attention, we won’t attract visitors and we won’t generate any demand.
> 
> So our mission and every piece of content within it must answer this question: _Why do they care? How does this help them? What task can they complete once they are finished reading this?_
> 
> ![Content Mission Venn Diagram](/.attachments/content.core.mission.jpg)
> 
> This is the core of our mission.
> 
> ...
> 
> Our marketing positioning statement (also known as a value proposition) describes our place in the market. ...
> 
> Put simply, this describes why we are in business. How we fit into our market.
> 
> To **[target audience]** that has \
> **[unmet need]**, our company is the \
> **[competitive set]** that has 
> **[unique point of difference]** because it \
> **[evidence 1, 2 and 3]**.
> 
> _Fill in these blanks before doing any marketing._
> 
> ...
> 
> The marketing position statement is general to the entire business, not specific to content. And it’s typically an internal document; it isn’t made public or posted online.
> 
> Here is a mission statement template that goes one level deeper. ... The final step in this template is very powerful since it forces us to name the actual tasks that our content will enable our audience to complete.
> 
> The content we produce helps our company accomplish **[goal]** and **[goal]** by providing **[adjective]** and **[adjective]** content that makes **[audience description]** feel **[emotion]** or **[emotion]** so that they can **[task]** or **[task]**.
> 
> _Fill in these blanks before going deeper into content marketing._
> 
> At this level, it gets easier. Social media falls under content marketing, so this template will look familiar. Our social media mission is a subset of your content marketing mission.
> 
> ...
> 
> Our social media account is where **[target audience]** can find **[what content]**.
> 
> Filling in these two simple blanks for each social network you use will guide us in what to share and how to engage with each community. Is it inspiration? Share quotes. Is it educational? Share links. Documenting this will help us stay on topic.
> 
> _Fill in these blanks before becoming active within a social network._
> 
> The most expensive mistake: missing our target.
> 
> The road to success is lined with burning wrecks of marketing campaigns that targeted the wrong audience, created the wrong content or built relevance in an irrelevant social network.
> 
> ...
> 
> At Orbit, one of our clients launched a site and simultaneously hired a PR firm to promote it. Rather than write an original press release, the PR firm simply copied the text from the website homepage and submitted it to the online newswires. Within minutes, there were more than 1,000 instances of that home page content on the web.
> 
> Google flagged this as likely spam and blacklisted the domain. Suddenly, the website disappeared from search results, even for searches for the business name. Imagine not ranking for the name of your business. Devastating.
> 
> ...
> 
> You’re an expert, with lots of specialized knowledge and skills. And there’s a lot of demand for that knowledge. Search is how we’ll connect your expertise with that audience.
> 
> It would be good for you and your business if they find you. Keyword research is the first step to make that happen.
> 
> If we know what they’re looking for, we’ll be able to help them find us. That’s why I research keyphrases before writing almost anything. It’s It would be foolish not to align my content with a keyphrase for which people are searching. Rather than simply writing content on a topic I find interesting, I can write content on a topic I find interesting and people are looking for.
> 
> Investigating keyphrases is like reading the minds of millions of people. It may sound strange, but I look up the popularity of words and phrases almost every day.
> 
> ...
> 
> As a content marketer, the two primary uses for keyphrase research are to find phrases to include in your content and to get ideas for new content. By doing keyphrase research, you’ll create content that is more friendly for search engines and more relevant to your audience.
> 
> ...
> 
> The ideal keyphrases are those that meet three criteria: many people are searching for them (high search volume), the website has a realistic chance of ranking relative to other sites (low competition) and the page that would rank is relevant to your business.
> 
> ...
> 
> Websites with higher Domain Authority have exponentially more credibility in search. A site with a Domain Authority of 60 may have eight times as much link popularity as a site with an authority of 50. Authority is plotted on a curve, not a line. ...
> 
> ![Domain Authority Curve](/.attachments/domain.authority.curve.jpg)
> 
> ...
> 
> Here’s how to research keywords fast. You can estimate your odds of ranking based on your Domain Authority and the keyword search volume. This is a shorthand way to quickly research keywords for which you can reasonably expect to rank.
> 
> | If your Domain Authority is ... | Target keyphrases with monthly searches of ... |
> |:--- |:--- |
> | less than 30 | less than 100 |
> | less than 50 | less than 1,000 |
> | less than 70 | less than 3,000 |
> 
> _Relevance_
> 
> It should go without saying that there is a third criteria for choosing keyphrases: relevance. It’s pointless to target a phrase that is completely irrelevant to your business. But it’s extremely useful to target phrases that are tangentially relevant and publish content that is useful to a broader audience beyond potential customers.
> 
> ...
> 
> In very competitive industries, it’s impossible to rank for the buyer-related phrases without having a robust content marketing program. The reason is simple. No content, no links. No links, no rank for the dollar sign phrases. No rank, no traffic. No traffic, no leads.
> 
> ![Visitors to Leads](/.attachments/visitors.to.conversion.jpg)
> 
> ...
> 
> Rather than simply write a great blog post, we took a few minutes to do the research using the Keyword Tool. We discovered that the phrase “graphic design vs. web design” is searched 58 times per month.
> 
> When checking competition in Google, there didn’t seem to be any popular domains ranking high. The sites that were ranking didn’t seem to be well-optimized (i.e., they didn’t have the phrase at the beginning of their title). It seemed we had found a very specific phrase with relatively low search volume but with very low competition. Bingo.
> 
> _Graphic Design vs. Web Design: Separate and Not Equal_, went live way back in June, 2010. In less than a week, it was ranking like a champion. It’s been in the first or second position for that phrase ever since. For the first few months, people visited it once or twice a day. Then a few sites began linking to it and traffic increased. When a high-profile blog linked to the article, it jumped again.
> 
> ...
> 
> Pages tend to rank higher in search engines when they are tightly focused on a single topic. It’s unlikely that one page will rank high for a dozen phrases. So if we expect to rank, we need to pick a phrase and create a great page on that topic.
> 
> But what about just two phrases? Can we optimize a page for a primary and secondary keyword? Yes. But only if we pick phrases that meet one of these two criteria:
> 
> 1. **Two phrases with overlapping words:** Ideally, the two keyphrases share words. Even better, the primary keyword is a subset of the secondary keyword. Here are some examples:
>    - **Bad**: _“Social media for beginners”_ and _“Twitter tips”_: These phrases may share a meaning, but they don’t share any words.
>    - **Good**: _“How to research keywords”_ and _“Keyword research tips”_: These two phrases both share two words, keyword and research, but the words appear in different order within the phrases.
>    - **Better**: _“Google Authorship markup”_ and _“Google Authorship”_: Here, the second phrase is contained within the first phrase. One phrase is really just a more specific version of the other.
> 
> 2. **Two phrases with similar semantics and synonyms:** When you searched for your initial phrase in step three above, did you see any different, but related words or phrases bolded in the search results? If so, you’ve found an example of Google using semantic indexing.
> 
>    When you notice these words, it’s a sign that you can target both phrases on one page, even if you’re just using one of them in your writing. This allows you to target a secondary keyword that shares the same meaning as the primary keyword, even if the actual words aren’t the same.
> 
> Headlines are _first impressions_. You will be judged immediately and ruthlessly by this short set of words. We all scan (and dismiss) headlines continually. That’s what “surfing the web” means. Skimming over waves of headlines.
> 
> Even if you do everything else right, slaving away in the salt mines of content, working your fingers to the bone, everything will fail if you get this one thing wrong.
>
> So here’s how to write a good headline.
> 
> ...
> 
> 1. **My Headline Makes a Promise** If you don’t explain what’s in it for the reader, don’t expect them to read it. Period. All great headlines are benefit-driven.
> 
>    So make a promise. Make it specific.
> 
>    Ask yourself as if you’re the reader: “What’s in it for me?” The answer should jump off the page. If it doesn’t, be ready to hear crickets. You’re about to fail.
> 
>    ...
> 
> 2. **My Headline Triggers Curiosity** Specific is good, but don’t give everything away. Here’s a headline I saw yesterday that I appreciated, but gave me no reason to click.
> 
>    “Average Full-Time Work Week is 47 Hours, Gallop Says”
> 
>    That’s interesting, but why click? I got the point already.
> 
>    A great headline triggers curiosity. It doesn’t give too much away. Masters of headlines, Buzzfeed and Upworthy, have perfected this craft. Here are some some of Upworthy’s most shared headlines, each of which got millions of visits.
> 
>    - 9 Out of 10 Americans Are Completely Wrong About This Mind-Blowing Fact

>    - 13 Things You Never Knew About Tequila
>    - Watch the First 54 Seconds. After That You’ll Be Hooked. I Swear.
> 
>    Teased? That’s the idea. You have to click to find out what they’re talking about.
> 
> 3. **My Headline Uses Numbers** List posts are popular for a reason: They set expectations about how much you’re getting yourself into. They also suggest variety; if you don’t like one thing, you might like something else.
> 
>    Numerals, not just numbers, are part of the magic. In a line of letters, numerals stand out. So don’t write a headline with “Eight Things,” write one with “8 things.”
> 
>    ...
> 
>    _Examples_:

> 
>    You get the idea.
> 
>    ...
> 
> 4. **My Headline Asks a Question** Question headlines have two benefits. First, they leverage a psychological effect, causing the reader’s mind to take the next step: answer the question …or wonder. The lack of completeness inherent in questions causes tension and interest in readers.
> 
>    Search is the second benefit. Google is focused on the meaning of a search query, not just combinations of words. It’s called “semantic indexing.” The natural language of a complete question helps Google understand how the article is useful.
> 
>    ...
> 
> 5. **My Headline Uses Power Words** Some words get clicked more than others. Other words get shared more. Word choice is critical to writing headlines. So choose carefully.
> 
>    Luckily, there’s data on which words get the best results. Here’s a summary of research on the power words.
> 
>    - Words that get more clicks from search results: _How to, [List-related numbers], Free, You, Tips, Blog post, Why, Best, Tricks, Great_
>    - Words that get shared more (appear most often in viral posts): _Smart, Surprising, Science, History, Hacks (hacking, hackers and “life hack” related topics), Huge / Big, Critical_
>    - Negative words that get shared more (negative words from viral posts): _Kill, Fear, Dark, Bleeding, War_
>    - Words that get retweeted more: _You, Twitter, Please, Retweet, Post, Blog, Social, Free, Media, Help_
>    - Words that increase email open rates: _Urgent, Breaking, Important, Alert_
> 
>    ...
> 
> 6. **My Headline Is Sized to Fit Its Purpose**
> 
>    Length matters. But different sizes fit different places. Headlines are everywhere, but they’re not one-size-fits-all. Here are places where your headline is likely to appear.
> 
>    - **Email Subject Lines** in the inbox
>    - **Posts and Tweets** in social streams
>    - **Search Results Pages** from your `<title>` tag
>    - **At the Top of the Page** in the header `<h1>` tag
> 
>    You don’t have to use the same headline in every location. Pro marketers will tailor the length to the location, writing different headlines for different places. Here’s a guide for “headline” length.
> 
>    |  | Ideal Length for "Headlines in various places" |
>    |:--- |:--- |
>    | Title tags | 55 characters |
>    | Email subject lines (for open rates) | 50 characters or less |
>    | Facebook post (for likes & shares) | 100-140 characters |
>    | Tweets (for retweets) | 120-130 characters
> 
> 7. **My Headline Puts the Keyword First**
> 
>    Using the target keyphrase at the beginning of the headline gives you good “keyphrase prominence,” helping to indicate relevance to search engines.
> 
>    It’s especially important for both the title tag `<title>` and the header `<h1>`. This is fundamental to on-page SEO best practices. It’s not important for email subject lines and social media post headlines.
> 
>    This may come naturally when you target longer, less competitive “how to” or question phrases. It’s more difficult when writing those Buzzfeed-style curiosity gap headlines.
> 
>    Conflicted? Yes, some of these tips contradict others. So here’s a pro-tip you probably haven’t seen before. This is part of our secret writing sauce here at Orbit…
> 
> 8. **My Headline Uses Punctuation (and a secondary headline)**
> 
>    Punctuation, such as colons, dashes and parentheses, also allow you to add a secondary headline, giving you two chances to catch the reader’s attention. Here are examples of double headlines that separate the first from the second with punctuation. Each leverages another of the techniques to catch readers’ attention.

> 
> - **Write lots of headlines before choosing one:** We write dozens before choosing one for an article.
> - **Write headlines that create some urgency:** Hurry up and do this before your competition does!
> - **Check the “emotional value” of your headline:** Put your headline into Advanced Marketing Institute’s _Headline Analyzer_, which will give you a percentage score of the emotional value. The higher, the better.

Hmm. I think shame and pride are basically the same thing.

> - **Add a fun theme, then share with specific people:** Adding a theme adds interest. If you write a zombie-themed article about search marketing, you can then find people who love zombies and SEO. There are 31 people with “zombie” and “SEO” in their Twitter bios.
> - **Keep your promises:** If the headline doesn’t fit the article, don’t use it or you’ll erode trust with your readers. That “ultimate guide” had better be the best. Those “5 Easy Ways” better not be complicated!
> 
> ...
> 
> Content marketers are writers. We write text in the form of posts. Blogging is a written, text-based medium, right? That’s true, but text is only part of it. Every great content marketer knows that the images are critical.
> 
> They are an all-important ingredient, a close second behind the headline. Every book needs a cover; every post needs an image.

> If your post doesn’t have an image, don’t expect it to go very far.
>

> 
> 1. **My Image Contains the Headline or a Quote**
> 
>    The “featured image” is the image that appears at the top of the post. It’s also typically the image that appears in social streams when the post gets shared.
> 
>    Do it well, and it will get clicked and reshared. Do it poorly, and viewers will scroll right past.
> 
>    One way to do it well is to _put the headline right into the image_. That way, the image contains the full meaning of the article and will stand on its own.
> 
>    ...
> 
>    By putting the headline into the image, people who even glance at the image will know the topic of the post.
> 
>    ...
> 
> 2. **My Image Has a Face**
> 
>    Faces are unique among all other possible imagery. They are unlike any other type of image. From the time we are infants, we have a tendency to stare at faces more than any other visual. Babies are more likely to gaze at shapes that resemble faces, even if it’s not an actual face.
> 
>    This is a hardwired visual preference. A cognitive bias built into all of us. Photo editors at magazines and newspapers have known this for decades. Images of faces grab and hold readers’ attention.
> 
>    :bulb: If you don’t have pictures of people in your website’s “About” section, add some immediately. Regardless of what industry you’re in, it helps to be a person. Humanize your site by adding pictures of your team.
> 
>    Faces create another subtle marketing opportunity. You can direct the viewer’s attention in specific directions.
> 
>    Eye tracking studies show that “you look where they look.” If the eyes in the image are looking in a certain direction, the eyes of the viewer will be pulled in that same direction.
> 
>    ![Power of the Eyes](/.attachments/power.of.the.eyes.jpg)
> 
>    The direction of the eyes creates an invisible arrow, irresistible to visitors. This can help you guide the visitors’ eyes toward the headline, pulling them into the content. Blogging pros and landing page designers have used this tactic for years.
> 
> 3. **My Image is Sized Properly for Social Media**
> 
>    ...
> 
>    The size doesn’t matter. It’s the shape of the image that counts. All of the social networks automatically resize photos for their social streams. As long as the image is roughly twice as wide as it is tall, it will look fine on every social network.
> 
>    If it’s taller than it is wide, the social network will likely cut off the top and bottom. The width-to-height ratio is called the “aspect ratio.” Images that are wide are called “landscape,” and images that are tall are called “portrait.” Give your blog images a landscape aspect ratio, or at least be sure that the focus of the image is centered vertically.
> 
> 4. **My Images are Consistent and Align with my Brand**
> 
>    If you establish your own style, readers will come to recognize it. It also speeds up the process of making images because a lot of design decisions are made in advance, such as layout, fonts and colors.
> 
>    ...
>
> 5. **My Images Explain Complex Concepts and Processes**
> 
>    Visuals make complicated things simple, even enjoyable to understand. They are fast shortcuts that save the visitor from reading paragraphs of text. ...
> 
>    Any time your meaning can be explained through a flow chart, pie chart or Venn diagram, take the time to sketch it out and add it to the post. It doesn’t have to be beautiful. It’s better to have an ok diagram that adds clarity than no diagram at all.
> 
>    ...
> 
> 6. **My Content Uses Multiple Images**
> 
>    Accept it. Your readers are really just scanners. According to research by NN Groups, the average visitor reads 28% of text on web pages, at most. This calculation is based on the average number of words on pages, the average time spent on page and the average reading speed of visitors. 28% is actually optimistic. The real number is probably closer to 20%.
> 
>    So how can you slow these scanners down? _Multiple images_.
> 
>    Your readers should never hit a wall of text. In other words, as they scroll down, at no point in your article should there be a screen of all text with no images. Images will keep readers flowing through the article, increasing the chance of catching their attention and slowing them down.
> 
>    Add an image every 500 pixels or so, usually after every three or four paragraphs.
> 
>    ...
> 
> 7. **I Have Permission to Use My Images**
> 
>    Not getting sued is always good. And it’s easy if you know where to look for images. Search tools at Flickr allow you to filter for images covered by the Creative Commons license, with levels of permission.
> 
>    The Google Images search tool also includes filters for usage rights. Check these before searching for that picture of wheelbarrows full of puppies.
> 
> ...
> 
> No one loves stock images. But they’re far better than no image at all. The problem with stock photos (especially stock photos of people) is that they are inauthentic. And it’s obvious.
> 
> ...
> 
> Short paragraphs let them get the meaning in short bursts. Many visitors scan down the page, glancing at headers and subheaders, then dive deeper into the paragraphs if something catches their interest.
> 
> ...
> 
> Designers know that visitors love white space, but somehow, _writers didn’t get the message_. Don’t write walls of text. Break up paragraphs to create white space on the page.
> 
> _The ideal length for a paragraph is 3 to 4 lines maximum_.
> 
> ...
> 
> When David Waterhouse analyzed the length of the top 50 YouTube videos, he found the average length was 2 minutes, 54 seconds. Clinton Stark reported that Google researchers from the YouTube team confirmed this recommended length.
> 
> ...
> 
> If a title is too long, it gets truncated, and people won’t be able to read it all. The cutoff point is around 60 characters. So use the target keyphrase once and keep it short. ...
> 
> _The ideal length for a title tag is 55 characters_.
> 
> As with the title tag, the meta description is visible in search results, and it gets cut off if it’s too long.
> 
> It should be a single sentence in plain English, summarizing the content of the page. Use the target keyphrase once and don’t make it too long.
> 
> _The ideal length for a meta description is 155 characters_.
> 
> ...
> 
> _Every piece of content should be as long as it takes to convey the message, and no longer_.
