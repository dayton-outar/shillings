## Chapter 1. Welcome to Content Chemistry

> To be successful, websites must do two things: 1) attract visitors, and 2) convert those visitors into leads and customers. To do this, web marketers must do two things: 1) create content, and 2) promote it. Great content makes the difference between success and failure on the web.
> 
> ...
> 
> **What is Content Marketing?**
> 
> Content marketing is the art and science of pulling your audience toward your business. It is based on the concept that relevant prospects are looking for your product or service right now. If you can connect with them, help them and teach them, some of them will become loyal customers.
> 
> _Content marketers create and promote useful, relevant information with the goal of attracting and engaging website visitors, and then converting those visitors into leads and customers._
> 
> We do this by creating, publishing and promoting content that is relevant to our clients and prospects through three main channels: search engine optimization (SEO), social media and email marketing.
> 
> Content marketing is sensitive to the behaviors and psychology of potential buyers. Whether we’re looking for jet engines or consulting services, a wedding DJ or a local florist, we are all more likely than ever to look to the internet before making a decision. Every day, we search, research, read recommendations and seek advice from experts.

> In the beginning ...
> 
> Marketing was dominated by advertising, and that meant buying media. It meant _buying space_ in newspapers, hoping consumers would notice before they turned the page. It meant _buying time_ on TV, hoping consumers would keep watching when the show cut to a commercial break.
> 
> ...
> 
> Traditional advertising became less effective.
> 
> **Content Marketing vs. Advertising**
> 
> Content marketing (also known as inbound marketing) is actually nothing new. It is simply using content to connect with potential buyers and partners. The content earns the interest and trust of the audience by being entertaining or informative.

> 
> Content marketing is not only different from advertising, it’s the opposite of it. Content marketers attract their audience by being relevant. Advertisers inject themselves into other relevant media, hoping to be noticed. It’s pull versus push.
> 
> ...
> 
> In the words of marketing expert and New York Times bestselling author Jay Baer, content is the **help**. Advertising is the **hype**.
> 
> **Web Strategy and Website ROI**
> 
> Whether you’re spending your own cash or just investing your time, the return on investment in web marketing comes down to three main factors:
> 
> - Traffic (number of visitors)
> - Conversion rate (percentage of visitors taking action, becoming leads or subscribers, etc.)
> - Maintenance costs
> 
> ...
> 
> Everything a content chemist does should increase traffic and conversions while minimizing the cost and time in any way possible.
> 
> ...
> 
> Each time the site appears in a search results page is an “impression.”
> 
> ...
> 
> Two factors determine the total number of impressions: _the number of keyphrases a site ranks for and the rank for each keyphrase_.
> 
> ...
> 
> When the site ranks, it attracts an audience, and some of them will click. The percentage of searchers that click on site's listing [in an SERP (Search Engine Results Page)] is the “clickthrough rate,” or CTR. Each click is a visit.
> 
> ...
> 
> Getting traffic from search engines is great, but it’s not the same as leads. If a researcher looking for lab services finds a particular website, he’s not a lead yet. He’s just a visitor. When a visitor calls or fills out the site's contact form, he is officially a “conversion.” The better the site, the higher the “conversion rate.” There are many factors that determine the conversion rate, including design quality (brand loyalty and overall appeal), content format (text, images and video), the content itself (compelling, informative and relevant) and usability (navigation and an easy-to-use form).
> 
> ...
> 
> Now they need to convert the leads into actual customers. [Let's say that the sales team] can close around 50% of her leads. Each time they do this, they sell $1,000 worth of lab services. It costs them about $500 in time and overhead each time they provide this service. So generally speaking, the value of a lead to the company is about $500.
> 
> Now that we have all the pieces, we can put them together in a (very cumbersome but comprehensive) set of formulas for estimating the return on the investment for a marketing website.*
> 
> (Leads x Closing Rate)(Price-Time and Materials) = Profit
>
> ![Content Marketing Formulas](/.attachments/content.marketing.formulas.png)
>
> ....
> 
> Launching the site is just the beginning. There’s still is a lot of work to do, here's what is involved.
>
> - The ongoing work to get results in search engines. Search engine marketing takes time.
> - Create and promote relevant content consistently.
> - Boost traffic with a new email newsletter on a regular basis.
> - Following up on web leads and tracking them using a database.
> 
> ...
> 
> Here are the basic tools for content marketing:
> 1. Blog
> 2. Contact Form for Lead Generation
> 3. Email Service Provider (such as MailChimp)
> 4. Web Analytics
> 5. Social Media Presence

## Chapter 2. How it all Works

> ![Content Marketing Strategy Mind Map](/.attachments/content.marketing.mind.map.jpg)
> 
> **Strategy**
> 
> It all starts with a clear understanding of why you’re in business and how you deliver value to your customers.
> 
> 1. **Mission, Vision and Values**: Why are you in business? What is your core offering? What does your company stand for? Know these first, or you’re building your marketing on sand.
> 
> 2. **Research: Audience Needs, Market Size, Competitive Analysis**: Know your niche. How do you meet the demands of your audience? What is your place in the market? Are you up against big, consolidated competitors? Or are you in a fragmented market? _Content strategy is the bait to use, but audience strategy is the pond to fish in_.
> 
> **Branding**
> 
> Now you can create the perception you will project into the market. Branding is the perception of your position in the market, including all your content and imagery. It should be consistent from the first impression throughout the entire experience of each of your visitors and customers.
> 
> 3. **Position**: Now you can get specific about your target audience and their unmet needs. What is your unique point of difference? Use a positioning template to guide you through the positioning thought process.
> 
>    If you haven’t created your positioning statement yet, there’s a template for you in the Lab section.
>
> 4. **Messaging**: How can you best describe the value you provide? What evidence do you have to support your unique point of difference? Align your message with your position and your values. Find a clear and concise voice.
> 
> 5. **Visual Standards**: Create a visual continuity through colors, styles and type. Carry this through your website, your offline materials, your social networks, your email marketing and each piece of your content.
> 
> **Web Design**
> 
> ...
> 
> 7. **Keyword Research**: People are looking for you right now. If you find out what they’re searching for, you can align pages on the website with phrases that they’re searching for. Make sure to research keywords before you make the sitemap.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10. **Moodboards**: If the wireframes are about structure, the moodboards are about style. Here’s where the visual standards are executed online. Moodboards set background colors, button styles and type treatments for headers, links and body text.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Website Content**
> 
> You’ll create the website content during the web design process. Once the sitemap is final, the full scope of the content requirements is set. Finalize the initial content for the main marketing pages before development is complete, or it will delay the launch.
> 
> 14. **Strategy**: What questions does your audience have? What concerns? What do they desire, fear, trust and love? The website content topics and tone must align with the people who will be reading it. Create personas if necessary.
> 
> 15. **Write**: Write with these readers in mind [Buyer Personas]. Respect the time of the readers and be concise. Think ahead about traffic and use the target phrases. Pay close attention to formatting and internal linking. Select images and create videos that build credibility. Put your best foot forward, but be humble.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Create Content**
> 
> A website without a steady stream of useful content is just an online brochure. _It has no pulse_. It is simply an online advertisement. But add useful content and suddenly, there’s a bigger reason to visit. There’s a reason to share, to link and to open the newsletters. Content generates the trust that generates the fans, the leads and the sales.
> 
> 19. **Content Marketing Strategy**: A sustainable content marketing plan is based on the resources available: people, money and time, both internally and from vendors and partners. An effective content marketing plan is based on topics, tone and frequency that align with the needs of the audience. Personas and publishing calendars will help.
> 
> ...
> 
> 20. **Research**: A carefully researched article is more useful to your audience than an opinion piece. Visitors are more likely to search for, share, bookmark and read thorough “how-to” posts. Do your research and create something valuable. Surveys and original research with evidence are among the highest-value content on the web.
> 
> 21. **Create**: Write the posts, record the podcasts or shoot the videos—whichever _format_ is best for your audience. Use a ghostwriter, content template, content checklist or restaurant napkin—whichever _method_ is best for you and your team.
> 
> 22. **Curate**: Repurpose content from other sources, but add your own insights and perspective. Interviews, event recaps and article round-ups are all efficient ways to produce high-value content quickly.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Content Promotion**
> 
> Now we’re ready to promote our content. It’s not enough to just publish. Our focus here is content marketing, not advertising. That means making your content visible through search engine optimization, social media and email marketing. It’s time to market your marketing.
> 
> **Search Engine Optimization**
> 
> Ranking in search engines can provide a durable, consistent source of traffic. It requires research, careful writing, and a credible website and domain. This means enough link popularity to compete for the phrases you’re targeting.
> 
> 25. **Keyword Research**: As with web page content, blog posts and other content marketing should be aligned with keyphrases. As before, select keyphrases based on search volume, competition and relevance. ...
> 
> 26. **Guest Blogging**: Your content shouldn’t be limited to your own site. Writing high-quality content and submitting it to relevant blogs is good for branding and SEO. It’s a way to put your message in front of a new audience and make new friends.
>
> 27. **Search-Savvy PR**: Public relations activity can also create great linking opportunities. PR professionals who know the value of links take advantage of any media attention to seek authoritative links to specific web pages and blog posts.
> 
> 28. **Other Marketing Activity**: Of course, this goes beyond search optimization, but it’s worth noting that all kinds of offline marketing have potential search benefits. Events, partnerships, advertising, association memberships and sponsorships can all create link opportunities.
> 
> **Social Media**
>
> Social media marketing is a powerful channel for promoting content and an indispensable tool for online networking. Both of these outcomes are important for lead generation. Great social media marketing includes content promotion, content curation and one-to-one conversation.
> 
> 29. **Research**: Find specific people to connect with, such as prospects, bloggers, journalists, editors and influencers. Build lists of people to watch. Carefully research publications and blogs before pitching content.
> 
> 30. **Pitch**: For both PR and guest blogging, pitching content goes handin-hand with social media. Use social channels to build stronger connections gradually. Submit content with humility and sensitivity to the audience of the blog or publication. Always be thoughtful of editors’ time.
> 
> 31. **Social Sharing**: Post your content on the social networks where your audience spends time. Don’t be shy. Believe in your content and share each post multiple times over days, weeks and months. Deliberately share the post with people who will love what you wrote on social media and even with personal emails.
> 
> 32. **Conversation**: Don’t let your social stream fill up with promotional posts. Talk to people! Use social media as a tool for networking. When possible, move the conversation from casual mentions on Twitter to email, phone and face-to-face meetings.
> 
> **Email Marketing**
>
> Search engines and social networks are all owned by companies—but your email list belongs to you and your business. An engaged list of subscribers who look forward to your content is one of the most powerful tools for nurturing and generating leads.
> 
> 33. **Design and Production**: Your email template should be lightweight, mobile-friendly and easy to manage. Your subject line should be descriptive but leave room for curiosity. You should craft your teaser text and call to action to maximize clickthroughs.
> 
> 34. **Timing and Frequency**: When is your audience most likely to open? Friday at lunch or Saturday morning? How often should you send email? If your sales cycle is long, you may only need to send something monthly. Focus on quality, not quantity. Grow your audience by politely inviting your current prospects to join your list.
> 
> 35. **Testing**: Email marketing is easy to track, so each email is an opportunity for measurement and improvement. Use A/B test subject lines and experiment with timing. Add tracking codes using the Google URL Builder to compare campaigns. Keep experimenting and improving.
>
> ...
> 
> **Analytics**
> 
> Analytics is a decision support tool. Use it to do real analysis and check the results of experiments. The two most important numbers for lead generation are total traffic and conversion rate. Focus all your efforts on these two numbers.
> 
> 37. **Visitors and Overall Traffic Levels**: Adjusting for seasonality, is traffic up or down? Is your content attracting more visitors over time? Are the visitors bouncing after one page or going deeper into your website?
> 
> 38. **Traffic Sources**: Where are visitors coming from? Which of your promotion channels are effective? Which keyphrases, email campaigns and social channels are pulling in visitors?
> 
> 39. **Content Performance**: Which pages are connecting with visitors? Which topics are getting traction? Which are most successful at generating traffic and conversions?
> 
> 40. **Conversions**: The bottom line is the total number of leads or ecommerce sales. The total traffic times your conversion rate equals success. Other conversions include newsletter subscribers, job applicants and event registrants. Social follows are also conversions, but they don’t appear in Analytics.

## Chapter 3. Traffic Sources

> ...
> 
> As a content marketer, you must plan to generate traffic _through activity_. Let’s recategorize the traffic sources to align them with our three main content marketing techniques: search engine optimization, social media and email marketing.
> 
> **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**
> 
> ...
> 
> Ultimately, all SEO efforts have one focus: **to indicate that your site is relevant**. Every time you see or hear the phrase “search engine optimization,” substitute the words “indicating relevance” and you’ll have the right mindset for good SEO work.
> 
> Your goal is simply to help Google help people find you. Cooperate with Google and stay on its good side. The key to SEO is to have valuable content and confirm this to Google with great links from relevant sites.
>
> ...
> 
> According to Advanced Web Rankings’ ongoing tracking of clickthrough rates by search position, the first three spots in Google get almost 54% of all clicks. The top spot gets 26%, second place gets 17% and so on down the line. The numbers are even higher when the search term includes a brand name. Everyone knows that page two is no-man’s land, but not everyone realizes that ranking first drives six times as much traffic as ranking fifth.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Authority (link popularity)**: Are there many links to your website? Are the links from sites with high authority themselves?
> 
> **Relevance (on-page keyword usage)**: Is the keyword used on the page? Is the page relevant for the broader topic?
> 
> **Other page aspects**: Content length, load time, structured markup, etc.
>
> **User signals**: Are visitors clicking through from search results? Are they spending long or short periods of time on the page?
> 
> **Domain name**: Is the domain a popular brand? Is the keyword on the domain name?
> 
> **Social activity**: Quantity and quality of social media shares and mentions of the page.
> 
> Suddenly it’s clear that links on other people’s websites are a big factor in how high you rank in search engines. If you’re serious about SEO, getting good links has to be part of your content marketing efforts ...
>
> ..
> 
> Now that we have a general idea of how search engines work, let’s introduce the three key SEO-related activities that a content marketer should focus on:
> - Keyphrase research
> - On-page search optimization
> - Link popularity
> 
> ...
> 
> As a content marketer, you must carefully choose phrases that meet three criteria:
> 
> - **Search volume**: How many people are searching for this phrase?
> - **Competition**: How many websites are relevant for this phrase? Are they powerful sites?
> - **Relevance**: If someone found your site while searching for this phrase, would they be happy? Would you be happy they found you?
> 
> ...
> 
> Here’s a list of the most important places to use your target phrase to help Google understand that you are relevant. They are listed in order of importance.
>
> - **Title**: Between `<title>` and `</title>`.
> - **Headers**: Between `<h1>` and `</h1>` as well as `<h2>` and so on.
> - **Body text**: This is all the text on the page that isn’t within links.
> - **Meta description**: Although it doesn’t actually appear on the web page, the meta description often appears in search results as the snippet.
>
> ...
> 
> Think about it: if 1,000 websites link to a page about the U-505 submarine and each of those 1,000 links have text such as “learn more about the U-505 submarine,” then the page must be relevant for that topic. The links are a powerful indicator of relevance. This is especially true if those 1,000 sites are also about submarines and those sites have many inbound links themselves.
> 
> This is why link popularity is an excellent way for search engines to see what sites are really about. As we saw from the Moz research above, link popularity is a heavily weighted ranking factor. Why? Because it’s hard to fake. If SEO was only about which page uses the phrase most often, anyone could put “U-505 submarine” on the page a hundred times and rank high. Google would then be full of spam. This is why links matter so much.
> 
> ...
> 
> The best links are from sites that have a high link popularity themselves. These links are worth more. Just like a popularity contest, one vote from someone popular is worth more than a dozen votes from the unknown.
> 
> ...
> 
> Links from related sites are generally better. A link from a completely irrelevant site is not as valuable, since that site doesn’t have as much credibility on that topic.
> 
> ...
> 
> Now that you understand link popularity, consider your target keyword. The likelihood of ranking for that phrase depends on the competition.
> 
> Do the high-ranking sites for the keyword have higher link popularity than you? Then choose another keyword.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lots of times, link text is simply “click here” or “www.example.com.” But when link text includes a keyword, it can be another indication of relevance. If the links to a page say “flying carpet safety,” then Google is likely to believe that this is what the page is about.
> 
> ...
> 
> When too many links to a page include the target keyword, it may look spammy. Google may penalize you for “over-optimization.”
>
> Don’t try too hard to get links with your exact keyword as link text. It looks unnatural. Balance is good.
> 
> ... Website owners can tell Google not to follow certain links by adding a tiny code that says “nofollow.” Google skips these links, which then have much less value (if any) to the website on the other end. Today, most popular blogs have links within comments set to “nofollow,” so blog commenting is not considered an important SEO tactic.
>
> ...
> 
> There are actually two types of relevance and two types of keyphrases. They attract two different types of visitors. _Understanding this is key to content marketing_.
> 
> ...
> 
> The keyphrase indicates the visitors’ intent. There are two types of keyphrases: question marks and dollar signs.
> 
> ... If you want a lot of leads, you have to help a lot of researchers.
> 
> ...
> 
> _“Companies have to create content that transcends the transaction-—content only about your products and services is called a brochure.”_
> 
> - Sites without content marketing are truly just ads. They’re known as brochure-ware websites. They don’t have pages that teach, help, inspire or entertain. They don’t target the broader set of phrases. They don’t attract a larger audience.
> 
> - Sites that do publish search optimized educational content often attract huge audiences. The goal of the content marketer is the unlock the expert knowledge within their organization and offer it to the world, growing attention and, ultimately, demand.
> 
> Build a mini-version of Wikipedia for your industry.
> 
> ...
> 
> In the end, ranking in search engines and indicating your relevance comes down to great content written by a credible author and supported by great links. In other words, if you want to rank high, be good. Build and maintain a great online presence. If you are the best site on the Internet for that topic, Google will try hard to help people find you.
> 
> Target good keyphrases, use them in appropriate ways and look for opportunities to get high-quality links to your site. But above all, _strive to be truly relevant_.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Social Media Marketing**
> 
> Traffic from social media is the direct result of activity. Unlike traffic from search engines, where one page may rank well for years, social media requires ongoing work. If you stop promoting content on social media, traffic from social networks will naturally drop. This is because social streams move fast. Most of the clicks, shares and interactions happen within hours or minutes of posting your article.
> 
> But it’s very hard to predict what people will share or click. Who knows what’s going to go viral tomorrow? People may love a post on one network, but ignore it on another. Last week, everyone liked that post. But today, it was mostly ignored. Social traffic is notorious for spikes and troughs, peaks and valleys.
> 
> ...
> 
> ... Social media is a powerful, efficient way to connect with the people who have already built the audience you’re targeting.
> 
> Our goal is to connect with people who have already built the audience you need to reach… Then borrow that audience in a sensitive and considerate way.
> 
> There are names for this kind of work: online networking, influencer marketing, blogger relations or just digital PR.
> 
> ...
> 
> So who creates content? Who can we connect with that might mention, link and share their authority?
> 
> - Journalists
> - Authors
> - Podcasters
> - Academic Researchers
> - Event Producers
> - Bloggers and Blog Editors
> 
> ![How Relationships Affect Lead Generation](/.attachments/lead-generation-social.media.jpg)
> 
> ...
> 
> Promoting your own content is only one type of social media post. If that’s the only thing you share, you’re missing out on the networking benefits, and your account won’t be a lot of fun to follow. You’re using social as a dumping ground for links.
> 
> Really, there are three types of social media posts. (Fig. 4e)
> 
> - ⅓ of your posts are your own content, driving traffic to your website.
> - ⅓ of your posts are news, ideas and advice from other people in your industry, shared partly to help your audience and partly to build relationships with those influencers.
> - ⅓ of your posts are personal interactions, saying thank you, asking / answering questions and talking to people directly, with influencers as well as customers, strangers, friends and anyone else!
> 
> ![Social Media vs Online Networking](/.attachments/social.media-vs-online.networking.jpg)
> 
> ![Social Media Network Comparison Chart](/.attachments/social.media.posts.share.jpg)
> 
> Together, these types of posts combine to drive traffic, build a brand, grow a personal network and, eventually, drive rank and revenue.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Email Marketing**
> 
> Although it may now seem like traditional digital marketing, email marketing is a powerful traffic generator. We don’t know any serious content marketers who don’t use email marketing.
> 
> ...
> 
> Ethical email marketers keep the following principles in mind:
> 
> - List growth
> - List cleanliness
> - Email timing
> - Subject lines
> - Content and calls to action
> - Testing and reporting
>
> ...
> 
> The long-term goal of email marketing is to always measure results and continually improve. But unless you add special tracking code, the traffic from your email campaigns will be mixed together with all your other traffic in Google Analytics, making it harder to measure what people are doing after they arrive.
> 
> To make the traffic from email appear separately in Google Analytics, use the Google URL Builder. Put each link from your email into this tool, then add the three main parameters into the form: Campaign Source, Campaign Medium and Campaign Name.

## Chapter 4. Conversions

> All visitors—all of us—want our problems solved and our desires fulfilled. Maybe we were thinking of the problem or the desire when we came to the site, or maybe not. Either way, _visitors convert into customers when the hope for a solution is stronger than the fear that they’ll be disappointed_.
>
> So there are two factors at work: One is pulling them toward conversion, and the other is friction that is pushing them away.
> 
> If the motivation is stronger than the friction, the visitor converts, meeting their goals and yours.
> 
> ![Motivation vs Friction](/.attachments/user.motivation-vs-friction.jpg)
> 
> Generating leads and sales is the ultimate goal of most websites, but there are many types of conversions, and all of them are good. The smaller successes are important steps toward turning visitors into fans and fans into customers.
> 
> ...
> 
> Many factors determine the percentage of visitors that convert.
> 
> **Relevance and traffic source**: Is the website relevant to the visitor you attracted? How targeted is the website traffic? For example, visitors from social media are generally less likely to buy something or become a lead than visitors from search engines, because they typically don’t have strong intent..
> **Overall design appeal of the site**: Does the site look professional? Credible?
> **Clarity**: Is the main message of the website clear? Is it obvious what the company does? Or is the main message general and vague, such as “world class service”?
> 
> ...
> 
> ---
>
> :bulb: **The 5-Second Test** To confirm that the site is communicating quickly and clearly, show it to someone who isn’t familiar with the brand. Don’t prepare them. Just say “I want to show you something” and pull up the site. After five seconds, turn off the screen. Now ask them. “What does this company do?” If they can’t tell you, the site has failed the test. When you ask the person what they remember about the site, you’ll learn which elements are the most visually prominent. Any surprises?
>
> ---
> 
> If the site doesn’t pass the 5-Second Test, expect a low conversion rate.
> 
> - **Descriptive navigation**: Do the labels of the links and buttons help the visitor accurately predict what they’ll find when they click? Are they explicit? Or are they generic, such as “services”?
> 
> - **Provides key information**: Does the website answer the visitors’ most important questions? Does it address common objections?
>
> - **Simple words**: Does the site use simple, easy-to-understand language? Or does it use fancy jargon that some visitors may not quickly grasp?
> 
> - **Content format**: Is the content presented in a visual, compelling format, such as images and video? Is the textbased content legible and formatted for easy scanning and reading?
> 
> - **Trust and evidence**: Does the content include evidence of legitimacy? Do other people trust this brand? To increase trust, add “social proof” and other evidence, such as prominent testimonials, client logos, positive reviews, press mentions, industry credentials, association memberships, number of customers and years in business.
> 
> ![The Definitive Guide to Lead Generation](/.attachments/form.length-vs-conversion.rate.jpg)
> 
> ..
> 
> - **Obvious calls to action**: Does the site offer easy-to-find calls to action? Do the imagery and colors guide the visitors’ attention to the desired actions? Are there other distractions that pull attention away from the conversion buttons?
> 
> - **Urgency**: Does the site trigger “loss aversion” and remind visitors that they may risk, miss or lose something by not acting quickly?
>
> - **Short, easy forms**: Are the forms short and easy to complete? Or are they greedy, asking more questions than the visitor feels are necessary?
> 
> A site that aligns well with these elements will convert a higher percentage of visitors. Our goal is to add clarity, trust and relevance, while removing distraction, confusion and annoyance. Studies show that shorter forms convert at a higher rate.
> 
> ---
>
> :bulb: Typically, an overall conversion rate of 3% or more is considered high. If the conversion rate is 1% or lower, something is probably wrong.
> 
> ---
> 
> The better you understand your target audience, the more likely you are to create an online experience that converts well. When possible, create personas, send surveys or do focus group testing. If nothing else, talk to the sales and customer service teams to learn what questions, concerns and objections your potential customers have.
> 
> If you can discover the things that pique visitors’ interest; create urgency; and address any fears, uncertainties and doubts, it’s easier to create a website and develop content that speaks to visitors directly. This is great for your conversion rate.
> 
> 
> ---
>
> :bulb: Create content that addresses the questions and concerns that are specific to various stages in the buying process and the conversion funnel.
> 
> ---
> 
> There is an inverse correlation between the length of a form and the percentage of visitors who fill it out and submit. Studies show that shorter forms convert at a higher rate.
> 
> Resist the temptation to create a “warmer lead” by asking for too much information. Long forms are considered “greedy.” Often, you can gather the information you’re looking for when you follow up on the lead offline. For lead generation forms, include and require the minimum number of fields: name, phone number, email, and possibly company name and message.

> In our experience designing and building websites at Orbit Media, we have found that the subsequent page after a first conversion is an excellent place to let the visitor take action again. If visitors had enough interest and trust to take action once, they may take action twice if offered the opportunity on the thank you page.
> 
> The trick is to first give visitors what they want. For example, many ecommerce shopping carts ask visitors to create an account before checking out. This isn’t what the visitors were hoping for. They clicked “buy now,” not “buy after I give you my email address and password.”
> 
> In the Analytics accounts of our clients, we’ve seen the lack of a “guest checkout” option reduces sales by 30-50%. Requiring visitors to create accounts first is simply greed for more information on the part of a self-centered website owner. This is counter to the principles of content marketing. First, we give visitors what they want. Then, they may give us what we want.
> 
> On one website, we added the option to create an account after the checkout process. We included two simple sentences of benefit copy: “We’ll remember your address for a faster checkout next time. We’ll also store your order history and let you create a wishlist.” The percentage of shoppers who created accounts increased by 40%.

> “Enter email address” next to a subscribe button isn’t exactly a great pitch for your newsletter. On the other hand, if you include the right message next to that signup box, you may see a higher conversion rate for subscribers.
> 
> - **State the topic**: If the visitor can’t tell what the newsletter is going to be about, you aren’t conveying the value of subscribing.
> 
> - **Indicate frequency**: If the visitor can’t tell how often the newsletter is coming, they may hesitate to subscribe.
> 
> - **Social proof**: Show the number of subscribers or a testimonial to indicate that others appreciate the content.

> ... the percentage of website visitors who take action is called the conversion rate. Set up rates for each possible conversion on any website as separate goals within Google Analytics. This will allow you to measure the success of each, and then optimize the site to convert better. This is called conversion rate optimization (CRO).

> :bulb: Although form submissions are the main type of conversions, you can set up Google Analytics to measure other actions as goal completions, including time spent on the website, number of pages viewed and PDF downloads.

> To optimize the site for conversions, you need to see where any problems are and what needs to be fine-tuned. To help you see what’s happening on and around the conversion pages, Analytics has a report called “funnel visualization.”[^1]

> 
> Now that you can see this activity, you can look for ways to improve the site to make it more compelling and easier to use. If the number is low, ask yourself the following questions:
> 
> - Did the site answer enough of visitors’ initial questions?
> 
>   Talk to the sales team to learn the most common questions and objections. Add content that answers top questions and addresses top concerns.
>
> - Did the site connect with visitors as people?
> 
>   The site should connect on a human level, through pictures of the team, videos from company leadership, photos of your offices, etc.
> 
> - Does the site convey trust?
> 
>   If not, add third-party credentials, badges for certifications, association memberships, testimonials, case studies, security information (ecommerce) and content that demonstrates experience and expertise.
> 
> - Is the site easy to use?
> 
>   Make sure the forms are short, and name pages and sections properly. Any tiny bit of confusion between the website and the visitor is friction. The site should guide visitors effortlessly through the series of pages that teaches them, helps them and gently offers to let them take action.
> 
> - Is the content compelling?
> 
>   All the text and video on the top pages must be concise and compelling. When visitors leave the contact form and go to other pages, they’re giving you another chance.
> 
> Two numbers determine your results: traffic and conversions. Traffic times the conversion rate equals leads and revenue. Now that you have a balanced view of both halves of the equation, you can approach web marketing more efficiently. Always try to diagnose and fix the biggest problems first and grab the lowest-hanging fruit.

> A great lead generation website has a specific set of pages, each with specific elements. Let’s break it down. The typical flow looks something like this.
> 
> ![Conversion Funnel](/.attachments/lead.generation.stages.pages.jpg)
> 
> The website gently leads the visitor through a series of steps: awareness, interest, trust, then action. That’s a classic “conversion funnel.” Notice how the pages align with steps in the funnel:
> 
> 1. **Blog post**: Attracts visitors with useful information (awareness)
>
>    It all starts before the visitor arrives at the website. They may come from email marketing or social media, but often, it starts with a search.
> 
>    Your audience is constantly looking for information relevant to your field, so the key is to write many helpful blog posts and align the articles with keyphrases. The articles should be so useful that the readers will be glad to have found you.
> 
>    While they’re there, they will find easy ways to get more of your helpful advice through email marketing (a prominent sign-up form), social media (icons that let them follow you) or more content (internal links to related content).
> 
> 2. **Web page**: Explains what you do (interest)
> 
>    Here’s where you begin selling. Like the blog post, the information here is helpful, but now it describes how you do the work for the prospect. The goal is to state the value you provide in simple terms, and provide evidence that you are legitimate.
> 
> 3. **About page**: Explains why you do what you do (trust)
> 
>    Visitors want to know who they might be working with. That’s why the “About” page is one of the most popular pages on every lead generation website. Here is where you put a face to the name, tell your story and explain your mission. In the words of Teddy Roosevelt, “Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.”
> 
>    Connecting the service to the people is critical, even if the organization is large and only the executives are listed here. Visitors who are interested in the service are always interested in the service provider.
> 
> 4. **Contact page**: Simple way to get in touch (action)
> 
>    The trick here is to get out of the way. It should be as effortless as possible with no distractions. Just a simple form. The idea is to start a conversation, not interrogate your visitors.
> 
> 5. **Thank you page**: They’ve completed the funnel and are now a lead (conversion)
> 
>    On many lead generation sites, this page is nothing more than two tiny words. That’s a missed opportunity. The thank you page is your first interaction with your new lead. Make it a good one by setting expectations. You’ve also got an opportunity here to create an even stronger connection.
> 
> A great blog post is the first step in the lead generation process. It should include all of the following elements.
> 
> 1. **Keyword-focused header**: Use the target keyphrase once in the <h1> header. Along with the <title>, this is one of the most important places to use the phrase.
> 
> 2. **Prominent email sign-up box with descriptive call to action**: A great email sign-up form tells people what they’re going to get and gives some evidence that it’s good.
> 
> 3. **Social media networks, but only those where you are truly active**: You don’t really want the visitor to leave your site, but if they do, send them to a network where you are truly engaged with your audience.
> 
> 4. **Compelling image or chart**: Every great post has a great image. This makes the post more attractive, both on your site and in the social streams when readers share it. This is your chance to explain concepts visually with informative charts or diagrams.
> 
> 5. **Helpful, detailed article**: It’s the deep, how-to content that positions you as the expert. These posts are more likely to rank in search engines and readers are more likely to share them. So go big. The more useful, the better.
> 
> 6. **Links to service pages and your about page**: It’s nice of you to give away your best advice, but it’s hard work, and it doesn’t necessarily generate leads. The pathway from posts to pages should be clear in the navigation.
> 
> 7. **Internal links to other blog posts and service pages**: Beyond the navigation, use internal links within your posts to guide visitors deeper into the site, both to other blog posts and to service pages.
> 
> 8. **Call to action for comments and more information**: Many visitors may get what they wanted from your super useful blog post and then leave. That’s fine, but to improve the chances that they’ll stick around, end each post with an invitation to get in touch for more information or with a question that invites a comment.
> 
> ![Blog Post Page](/.attachments/funnel.blog.post.page.jpg)
> 
> 9. **Contact link or phone number**: The top right corner is the standard place for contact information. Visitors will look for it here. Use a button to your contact page, your phone number or both.
> 
> 10. **Clear, simple description of services**: It’s best to call your services what your visitors would call them. Keep the language simple in your headers and body. Make sure to answer the questions that potential customers commonly ask. If you don’t, they may look for answers on other websites.
> 
> 11. **Evidence, examples, data and social proof**: Anyone can claim to do something, but not everyone can prove it. Add evidence of the benefits and return on investment of your services. This may include examples, statistics and research. Better yet, add social proof in the form of testimonials, using the voice of your happy customers.
> 
> 12. **Videos, demos and diagrams**: If you offer a service that requires a high degree of trust, videos are an excellent way to improve lead generation. They let the visitor see your face and hear your voice.
> 
>     If you offer a service that is difficult to explain, use diagrams and demos to explain those complex ideas.
> 
> ![Service Page](/.attachments/funnel.service.page.jpg)
> 
> 15. **Personality, values and your story**: Here you’ll answer the big questions: Why are you in this business? How long have you been doing this? What motivates your team? Why does this service matter?
> 
> ...
> 
> For the mobile-friendly version of your site, be careful where you put call to action buttons. Some parts of your page are right under the visitor’s thumb. Others are harder to reach.
