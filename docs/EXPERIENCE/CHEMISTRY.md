## Chapter 1. Welcome to Content Chemistry

> To be successful, websites must do two things: 1) attract visitors, and 2) convert those visitors into leads and customers. To do this, web marketers must do two things: 1) create content, and 2) promote it. Great content makes the difference between success and failure on the web.

> **What is Content Marketing?**
> 
> Content marketing is the art and science of pulling your audience toward your business. It is based on the concept that relevant prospects are looking for your product or service right now. If you can connect with them, help them and teach them, some of them will become loyal customers.
> 
> _Content marketers create and promote useful, relevant information with the goal of attracting and engaging website visitors, and then converting those visitors into leads and customers._
> 
> We do this by creating, publishing and promoting content that is relevant to our clients and prospects through three main channels: search engine optimization (SEO), social media and email marketing.
> 
> Content marketing is sensitive to the behaviors and psychology of potential buyers. Whether we’re looking for jet engines or consulting services, a wedding DJ or a local florist, we are all more likely than ever to look to the internet before making a decision. Every day, we search, research, read recommendations and seek advice from experts.

> Marketing was dominated by advertising, and that meant buying media. It meant _buying space_ in newspapers, hoping consumers would notice before they turned the page. It meant _buying time_ on TV, hoping consumers would keep watching when the show cut to a commercial break.

> **Content Marketing vs. Advertising**
> 
> Content marketing (also known as inbound marketing) is actually nothing new. It is simply using content to connect with potential buyers and partners. The content earns the interest and trust of the audience by being entertaining or informative.

> Content marketing is not only different from advertising, it’s the opposite of it. Content marketers attract their audience by being relevant. Advertisers inject themselves into other relevant media, hoping to be noticed. It’s pull versus push.

> 
> In the words of marketing expert and New York Times bestselling author Jay Baer, content is the **help**. Advertising is the **hype**.
> 
> **Web Strategy and Website ROI**
> 
> Whether you’re spending your own cash or just investing your time, the return on investment in web marketing comes down to three main factors:
> 
> - Traffic (number of visitors)
> - Conversion rate (percentage of visitors taking action, becoming leads or subscribers, etc.)
> - Maintenance costs
> 
> ...
> 
> Everything a content chemist does should increase traffic and conversions while minimizing the cost and time in any way possible.

> 
> Each time the site appears in a search results page is an “impression.”
> 
> ...
> 
> Two factors determine the total number of impressions: _the number of keyphrases a site ranks for and the rank for each keyphrase_.
> 
> ...
> 
> When the site ranks, it attracts an audience, and some of them will click. The percentage of searchers that click on site's listing [in an SERP (Search Engine Results Page)] is the “clickthrough rate,” or CTR. Each click is a visit.
> 
> ...
> 
> Getting traffic from search engines is great, but it’s not the same as leads. If a researcher looking for lab services finds a particular website, he’s not a lead yet. He’s just a visitor. When a visitor calls or fills out the site's contact form, he is officially a “conversion.” The better the site, the higher the “conversion rate.” There are many factors that determine the conversion rate, including design quality (brand loyalty and overall appeal), content format (text, images and video), the content itself (compelling, informative and relevant) and usability (navigation and an easy-to-use form).
>

> 
> Now they need to convert the leads into actual customers. [Let's say that the sales team] can close around 50% of her leads. Each time they do this, they sell $1,000 worth of lab services. It costs them about $500 in time and overhead each time they provide this service. So generally speaking, the value of a lead to the company is about $500.
> 
> Now that we have all the pieces, we can put them together in a (very cumbersome but comprehensive) set of formulas for estimating the return on the investment for a marketing website.*

> Launching the site is just the beginning. There’s still is a lot of work to do, here's what is involved.
>
> - The ongoing work to get results in search engines. Search engine marketing takes time.
> - Create and promote relevant content consistently.
> - Boost traffic with a new email newsletter on a regular basis.

## Chapter 2. How it all Works

> ![Content Marketing Strategy Mind Map](/.attachments/content.marketing.mind.map.jpg)
> 
> It all starts with a clear understanding of why you’re in business and how you deliver value to your customers.
> 
> 1. **Mission, Vision and Values**: Why are you in business? What is your core offering? What does your company stand for? Know these first, or you’re building your marketing on sand.
> 
> 2. **Research: Audience Needs, Market Size, Competitive Analysis**: Know your niche. How do you meet the demands of your audience? What is your place in the market? Are you up against big, consolidated competitors? Or are you in a fragmented market? _Content strategy is the bait to use, but audience strategy is the pond to fish in_.
