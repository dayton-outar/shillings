# Notes from The Brand Gap

© 2006 By Marty Neumeier

## Introduction

> To manage a brand is to manage something much less tangible—an aura, an invisible layer of meaning that surrounds the product.
>
> ...
>
> A brand is a _person’s gut feeling_ about a product, service, or company. It’s a GUT FEELING because we’re all emotional, intuitive beings, despite our best efforts to be rational. It’s a PERSON’S gut feeling, because in the end the brand is defined by individuals, not by companies, markets, or the so-called general public. Each person creates his or her own version of it. While companies can’t control this process, they can influence it by communicating the qualities that make this product different than that product. When enough individuals arrive at the same gut feeling, a company can be said to have a brand. In other words, a brand is not what YOU say it is. It’s what THEY say it is. A brand is a kind of Platonic ideal—a concept shared by society to identify a specific class of things.
>
> ...
>
> A brand, like Plato’s horse, is an approximate—yet distinct—understanding of a product, service, or company. To compare a brand with its competitors, we only need to know what makes it different. Brand management is the management of differences, not as they exist on data sheets, but as they exist in the minds of people.
>
> ...
>
> Today we base our choices more on symbolic attributes. What does the product look like? Where is it being sold? What kind of people buy it? Which “tribe” will I be joining if I buy it? What does the cost say about its desirability? What are other people saying about it? And finally, who makes it? Because if I can trust the maker, I can buy it now and worry about it later. The degree of trust I feel towards the product, rather than an assessment of its features and benefits, will determine whether I’ll buy this product or that product.
>
> ...
>
> Trust creation is a fundamental goal of brand design.

The foundation of brand is trust. Customers trust your brand when their experiences consistently meet or beat their expectations

What can our brand be trusted to deliver to our customers?

> If a company’s brand value is such a large part of its assets, why isn’t it listed on the balance sheet? Good question. But while companies ponder this, they’re already using brand values as tools to obtain financing, put a price on licensing deals, evaluate mergers and acquisitions, assess damages in litigation cases, and justify the price of their stock.

> A charismatic brand can be defined as any product, service, or company for which people believe there’s no substitute. Not surprisingly, charismatic brands often claim the dominant position in their categories, with market shares of 50% or higher. They also tend to command the highest price premiums—up to 40% more than generic products or services. And, most importantly, they’re the least likely to fall victim to commoditization.

Commoditization refers to the process by which goods, services, or even ideas become increasingly standardized, widely available, and interchangeable in the eyes of consumers. As a result of this process, products or services that were once unique or differentiated can lose their distinctiveness and may be perceived as interchangeable with similar offerings from competitors.

Commoditization often leads to intense price competition, as there is little perceived differentiation among the available options. This can result in reduced profit margins for businesses and a focus on cost-cutting measures (a race to the bottom). The term is commonly used in business and economics to describe a situation where products or services that were once considered premium or specialized become more commonplace and affordable, thus losing some of their unique value.

For example, in the technology industry, many electronic components and devices have gone through a process of commoditization as manufacturing processes become more efficient and competition increases. As a result, what was once cutting-edge technology may eventually become a standard, widely available product with lower profit margins.

Commoditization can have both positive and negative effects. On one hand, it can lead to increased affordability and accessibility for consumers. On the other hand, it can pose challenges for businesses that rely on differentiation to command premium prices and maintain healthy profit margins.

> Among the hallmarks of a charismatic brand are a clear competitive stance, a sense of rectitude, and a dedication to aesthetics. Why aesthetics? Because it’s the language of feeling, and, in a society that’s information-rich and time-poor, people value feeling more than information.

> Aesthetics is so powerful that it can turn a commodity into a premium product. Don’t believe me? Look at Morton. Ordinary table salt is the ultimate commodity—unless it has a little girl on the package.

The five disciplines of branding are,
 1. Differentiate
 2. Collaborate
 3. Innovate
 4. Validate
 5. Cultivate

## Differentiate

The three little questions,
 1. Who are you?
 2. What do you do?
 3. Why does it matter?

These questions attempts to get into the deeper reasons that customers choose a product (see "This is Marketing" by Seth Godin).

> Unless you have compelling answers to all three questions, meaning that customers find them irresistible, you haven’t got a brand.
>
> ...
>
> Clorox is a company that understands differentiation. When Clorox purchased Hidden Valley ranch dressing, their marketing people had the good sense not to add it to their product line and rename it Clorox Hidden Valley. In fact, the name Clorox has never appeared on any of Hidden Valley’s packages, advertisements, or other marketing materials. Yet you’d be surprised at how many companies have violated common sense and paid the price. The lesson? Keep it pure, keep it different.

### The Evolution of Marketing

> As we’ve moved from a one-size-fits-all economy to a mass-customization economy, the attention of marketing has shifted from features, to benefits, to experience, to tribal identification. In other words, selling has evolved from an emphasis on “what it has,” to “what it does,” to “what you’ll feel,” to “who you are.” This shift demonstrates that, while features and benefits are still important to people, personal identity has become even more important.

> The success of the Nike brand is ample proof that de Bono’s concept works. As a weekend athlete, my two nagging doubts are that I might be congenitally lazy, and that I might have little actual ability. I’m not really worried about my shoes. But when the Nike folks say, “Just do it,” they’re peering into my soul. I begin to feel that, if they understand me that well, their shoes are probably pretty good. I’m then willing to join the tribe of Nike.

### Globalism vs. Tribalism

> We’ve heard a lot of talk about globalism—the knocking down of national, economic, and cultural barriers to create a single society. In the 1960s Marshall McLuhan envisioned a world so connected by technology that the old divisions would disappear, made obsolete by a massive “global village.” Forty years later we have no global village, and we probably never will, at least in the usual sense of a village—an intimate community united by a single language and culture. Instead we have a global communication network, an electronic layer on top of the old divisions that influences them and adds to them, but doesn’t replace them.
>
> The fact is, we need divisions just as much as we need ways to transcend them. Without barriers there would be no safety—against war, disease, natural disaster, a feeling of alienation, of being lost in an uncaring world. The faster globalism removes barriers, the faster people erect new ones. They create intimate worlds they can understand, and where they can be somebody and feel as if they belong. They create tribes.
>
> If you stretch the concept of tribe just a little, you can see that a brand creates a kind of tribe. Depending on your Unique Buying State, you can join any number of tribes on any number of days and feel part of something bigger than yourself. You can belong to the Callaway tribe when you play golf, the VW tribe when you drive to work, and the Williams-Sonoma tribe when you cook a meal. You’re part of a select clan (or so you feel) when you buy products from these clearly differentiated companies. Brands are the little gods of modern life, each ruling a different need, activity, mood, or situation. Yet you’re in control. If your latest god falls from Olympus, you can switch to another one.

### Focus, Focus, Focus

> Yet focus is difficult to achieve because it means giving something up. It runs counter to our most basic marketing instinct: If we narrow our offering, won’t we narrow our opportunities for profit? Answer: Not necessarily. It’s often better to be number one in a small category than to be number three in a large one. At number three your strategy may have to include a low price, whereas at number one you can charge a premium. History has shown that it pays handsomely to be number one in your category—first, because of higher margins, and second, because the risk of commoditization is almost nonexistent. Yet number two can also be profitable, despite a smaller market share. Number three, or four, or five, however, may only be worth the effort if you think you have a realistic shot at becoming number two someday.
>
> Can’t be number one or number two? Redefine your category. The industrial-strength software product Framemaker only made it to number three as a word-processing product, but as a document-publishing product it quickly became number one, with double its previous sales. All it took was a change of focus.
>
> ...
> Brand extensions make less sense when they’re driven by a desire for short-term profits without regard to focus. What makes them especially seductive is that they can work remarkably well in the short term, even as they undermine the position of the brand. A recent example of defocusing by brand extension is the Cayenne, an SUV from Porsche. In a single misguided stroke, Porsche has pulled the rug out from under its reputation as a maker of classic sports cars. They maintain that the Cayenne is an example of Porsche innovation, but Porsche fans will say it’s a grab for profits in a tired market. Had Porsche invented the SUV, people might see it as innovation, but at the tail-end of the trend it looks more like greed—especially since Porsche is already highly profitable. Naturally, the new car will sell. It’s got the revered Porsche styling, engineering, and pedigree, all of which can be harvested through line extension. But the question is, what does Porsche now stand for?
>
> ...
>
> Even in the best of times, the principle of focus is a hard mistress, demanding fidelity, courage, and determination. And when a company faces additional pressure from stockholder expectations, political infighting, unexpected competition, or changes in management, there’s a temptation to extend the product line for short-term relief, even at the expense of its market position. Resist, because the long-term survival of a brand depends on staying focused. As positioning expert Jack Trout succinctly puts it, “differentiate or die.”

## Collaborate

### It Takes a Village to Build a Brand

> Management guru Peter Drucker maintains that the most important shift in business today is from “ownership” to “partnership,” and from “individual tasks” to “collaboration.” The successful company is not the one with the most brains, he suggests, but the most brains acting in concert. Brand managers and communication firms are responding to this new challenge in a number of interesting ways.

### The New Collaboratives

> The third model, the integrated marketing team, bears little resemblance to the traditional out-sourcing model. It sees branding as a continuous network activity that needs to be controlled from within the company. In this model, best-of-breed specialist firms are selected to work alongside internal marketing people on a virtual “superteam,” which is then “coached” by the company’s design manager. The advantages of this model are the ability to unify a message across media, the freedom to work with best-of-breed specialists, plus internal stewardship. This last benefit is important, because it means that brand knowledge can accrue to the company, instead of vanishing through a revolving door with the last firm to work on it. A drawback of an integrated marketing team is that it requires a strong internal team to run it.

### Hooray for Hollywood

> The network organization isn’t new; a successful model of unbundling has existed for years. It’s called Hollywood.
>
> A half-century ago, the major Hollywood studios not only owned the soundstages and backlots necessary for their movies, but also the producers, directors, writers, actors, cinematographers, musicians, PR specialists, and distributors. Some even built theater chains for the exclusive use of their own properties. As the dream machines cranked out hundreds of look-alike movies to feed their growing overhead, movie-making began to slide from craft to commodity. The independents soon learned how to end-run the mega-studios by producing high-quality “little” films and low-budget B-movies.
>
> What happened next? The big studios learned from the small ones, and began unbundling their vertically integrated companies. By switching to a network model, the studios could avail themselves of the best talent for each project, thereby creating unique products and shedding unnecessary overhead. In reversing the trend toward commoditization, they encouraged the growth of an artisan community, not unlike those that grew up around the cathedrals of Europe. Like the cathedral-builders, Hollywood specialists don’t see themselves as technicians, but as craftspeople working in a creative network.
>
> ...
>
> Thanks to the Hollywood model, design managers are now learning how to assemble top-notch teams of specialists, inspire them to work together productively—even joyfully—then disband them when the project’s over, only to reassemble them in a different configuration for the next project. The lesson hasn’t been lost on other industries. Soon every knowledge-based business will adopt some version of the Hollywood model, and, years from now, many will undoubtedly agree with Noel Coward’s statement that “work was more fun than fun.”

Take note of the movie credits in the image below that gives the Aha! about the Hollywood approach.

## Innovate

### Where the Rubber Meets the Road

> Innovation requires creativity, and creativity gives many business people a twitch. Anything new, by definition, is untried, and therefore unsafe. Yet when you ask executives where they expect to find their most sustainable competitive advantage, what do they answer? Innovation. Because the truth is, innovation lies at the heart of both better design and better business. It magnifies drive inside the organization. it slashes the costs of inefficiency, duplication, and corporate ennui. It confers the ability to produce uncommon, yet practical, responses to real problems.

### When Everybody Zigs, Zag

> Creativity, however, demands the opposite. It requires an unnatural act. To achieve originality we need to abandon the comforts of habit, reason, and the approval of our peers, and strike out in new directions. In the world of branding, creativity doesn’t require reinventing the wheel, but simply thinking in fresh ways. It requires looking for what industrial designer Raymond Loewy called MAYA—the Most Advanced Yet Acceptable solution. Creative professionals excel at MAYA. While market researchers describe how the world is, creative people describe how it could be. Their thinking is often so fresh that they zag even when they should zig. But without fresh thinking, there’s no chance of magic.

### Brand or Bland?

> ... Corporate America has a similar saying: “Don’t rock the boat.” No wonder people are afraid of signing off on new ideas—by keeping your head down you’re more likely to keep it attached. Then where will innovation come from? Most likely from the outside, or from people inside who think outside.

### Those Crazy New Names

> ... But Smuckers was a good name from day one—distinctive, short, spellable, pronounceable, likable, portable, and protectable. And while the company presents it as slightly silly, the name benefits strongly from onomatopoeia. “Smuckers” sounds like smacking lips, the preverbal testament to a yummy jam.
>
> ...
>
> Generally speaking, high-imagery names are more memorable than low-imagery names. Names constructed from Greek and Latin root words tend to be low-imagery names. Accenture and Innoveda come to mind. Names that use Anglo-Saxon words, or the names of people, tend to be high-imagery names, producing vivid mental pictures that aid recall. Think of Apple Computer and Betty Crocker. Some of most powerful names are those that combine well with a visual treatment to create a memorable brand icon.

> **The 7 Criteria For A Good Name:**
>
> 1. **Distinctiveness.** Does it stand out from the crowd, especially from other names in its class? Does it separate well from ordinary text and speech? The best brand names have the “presence” of a proper noun.
>
> 2. **Brevity.** Is it short enough to be easily recalled and used? Will it resist being reduced to a nickname? Long multi-word names will be quickly shortened to non-communicating initials.
>
> 3. **Appropriateness.** Is there a reasonable fit with the business purpose of the entity? If it would work just as well—or better—for another entity, keep looking
>
> 4. **Easy Spelling And Pronunciation.** Will most people be able to spell the name after hearing it spoken? Will they be able to pronounce it after seeing it written? A name shouldn’t into a spelling test or make people feel ignorant.
>
> 5. **Likability.** Will people enjoy using it? Names that are intellectually stimulating, or provide a good “mouth feel,” have a headstart over those that don’t.
>
> 6. **Extendibility.** Does it have “legs”? Does it suggest a visual interpretation or lend itself to a number of creative executions? Great names provide endless opportunities for brandplay.
>
> 7. **Protectability.** Can it be trademarked? Is it available for web use? While many names can be trademarked, some names are more defensible than others, making them safer and more valuable in the long run.

### Icons and Avatars

> Logos are dead! Long live icons and avatars! Why? Because logos as we know them—logo-types, monograms, abstract symbols, and other two-dimensional trademarks—are products of the printing press and mass communication. They evolved as a way to identify brands rather than to differentiate them. Today marketers realize that branding is not about stamping a trademark on anything that moves. It’s about managing relationships between the company and its constituents, conducting a conversation among many people over many channels. We still have the printing press at our beck and call, but we also have the Internet, TV, telemarketing, live events, and other media to work with. Icons and avatars respond to this new reality by jumping off the printed page and interacting with people wherever they are.
>
> Aristotle was a born brander. He believed that “perception starts with the eye,” and that “the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor.”

At this point, I was thinking that the Jamaican folklore around a visiting bee was symbolic of a coming fortune. In China, the bee symbolizes ambition and the success that comes from hard work. Could this be the avatar for Shillings?

### It's All Packaging

> While not all brands are products and not all products are sold at retail, a book on brand would be remiss to ignore the importance of packaging. For many products, the package is the branding. It’s also the last and best chance to influence a prospect this side of the checkout counter.
>
> In some retail environments, such as the supermarket, it’s possible for a package to reach 100% of people shopping in that category. For several seconds, or even a few precious minutes, the shopper is completely focused on the differences among brands. Previous intentions to buy one product over another are suddenly put aside and memories of past advertising are shoved into the background as the competing packages go “mano a mano” for the shopper’s attention. This is known as a branding moment.
> 
> Retail brand managers funnel a large portion of their marketing budgets into package design, because the return on investment is likely to be higher with packaging than with advertising, promotion, public relations, or other spending options. For many retail products, packaging not only makes the final sale, it strikes a significant blow for the brand, since experience with the product is often the best foundation for customer loyalty.
>
> Marketers know this, but they’re not sure what makes it work. How, exactly, does one package beat another at the point of sale? How much of the battle is won by logic and how much by magic? Is it science or art? As you might guess, it’s both. But since most marketers favor left-brain thinking, most packages end up heavy on facts and light on emotion, the ingredient customers want most. Instead, customers are greeted with features, benefits, and what one shopper I interviewed called “scientific mumbo jumbo.”
>
> Before you can create emotion with a package, however, you need to understand the natural reading sequence of your category. It so happens that customers process messages in a certain order, depending on the product, and messages presented out of order go unheeded.
>
> Here’s an example of a typical reading sequence: 
> 1. the shopper notices the package on the shelf—the result of good colors, strong contrast, an arresting photo, bold typography, or other technique; 
> 2. the shopper mentally asks “What is it?,” bringing the product name and category into play; 
> 3. then “Why should I care?,” which is best answered with a very brief why-to-buy message; 
> 4. which in turn elicits a desire for more information to define and support the why-to-buy message; 
> 5. the shopper is finally ready for the “mumbo-jumbo” necessary to make a decision—features, price, compatibilities, guarantees, awards, or whatever the category dictates.

### Does Our Website Look Fat in this Dress?

> Uncultivated websites shove a tangle of unruly data in your face, then expect YOU to sort it out: a typical home page tries to squeeze an average of 25 pieces of information, some of it animated, into an area the size of a handkerchief. The closest relative of today’s web page is a newspaper page, yet most home pages make newspaper pages seem easy to navigate. The concept of a natural reading sequence has yet to reach the bastion of bad taste we fondly call the web.
>
> ... But what exactly are the invisible chains keeping web design from achieving its full potential? It boils down to three: technophobia, turfismo, and featuritis.
>
> _TECHNOPHOBIA_, the fear of new technology, keeps a lot of skilled designers out of web design. They’re mostly afraid the technical demands of the medium will engulf their projects, leaving little time to work on the aesthetics. The result is that most web design, thus deprived of disciplined designers, still falls below the aesthetic level considered standard for catalogs, annual reports, and books.
>
> _TURFISMO_, the second problem, is the behind-the-screen politicking that transforms the home page into a patchwork of tiny fiefdoms. You can see exactly which departments have the power and which don’t, as turfy managers fight for space on the company marquee. Simplify the home page? Sure, but not at my expense!
>
> Finally, _FEATURITIS_, an infectious desire for MORE, afflicts everyone from the CEO to the programmer. The tendency to add features, articles, graphics, animations, links, buttons, bells, and whistles comes naturally to most people. The ability to subtract features is the rare gift of the true communicator. An oft-heard excuse for cluttered pages is that most people hate clicking, and prefer to see all their choices on one page. The truth is, most people LIKE clicking—they just hate waiting. Eternal waiting, along with confusion and clutter, are the real enemies of communication. Put your website on a diet. You’ll find that subtraction, not addition, is the formula for clear communication.

## Validate

### The New Communication Model

> The standard model for communication has three components: sender, message, and receiver. The sender (your company) develops a message (web page, ad, brochure, direct mail piece, etc.) and sends it to a receiver (your target audience). Communication complete.
>
> What this model fails to recognize is that real–world communication is a dialog. I say something to you, you say something back. You may say it only to yourself, like when you read a magazine ad, but your brain is nevertheless an indispensible component of the total communication system. You respond by buying the advertised brand, or by mentally storing the information for future use, or by simply turning the page. With the standard communication model, the sender doesn’t know—and seemingly doesn’t care—how the receiver actually responded.

> The standard model is an antique. Today we can no longer afford to close our eyes, catapult a message into the ether, cross our fingers, and hope that it hits the target. Companies need feedback. Feedback turns communication into something more like a theatre performance than a magazine. If we’re dying on stage, the audience lets us know. The feedback is immediate and unambiguous, which lets us make appropriate changes before the next performance.

![New Communication Model](/.attachments/103fig01.jpg)

> When we solicit feedback from customers, the communication model has a fourth component. The sender creates a message, sends it to a receiver, and, instead of stopping there, the communication continues as the receiver sends a message back. With every turn around the feedback loop, the communication gets stronger and more focused. The new model is a blueprint for revolution. It transforms marketing communication into a contact sport, and spectators into full participants.

### People are Different

> Over the last 15 years my firm has store-tested hundreds of package designs. When we first adopted this practice, the reactions of shoppers to our prototypes often differed in the extreme. One shopper would love design A, but hate—I mean HATE—design B. We began to realize that the audience for one product was likely to be different than the audience for another, and that its taste in design was also likely to be different. A little more delving revealed a fundamental split between two main personality types, those who relied mostly on hard information (facts) to make a purchase, and those who relied mostly on soft information (feelings).

![Peronal Interest Chart](/.attachments/personality_wheel.jpg)

> Eventually we were able to diagram the shades of difference we found in the shoppers we encountered. The chart above divides the world into four mindsets, based on people’s job interests: applying, creating, preserving, and discovering. “Appliers,” for example, gravitate toward graphics that are precise, realistic, and familiar, while “creators” go for the lyrical, abstract, and novel. Guess what? If you divide the chart down the middle, you have an approximate map of the left and right brain.

### Test is not a Four-letter Word

> An aversion to research has been known in the boardrooms of some of the world’s most innovative companies. Sony founder Akio Morita believed that testing new ideas was folly. “Our plan is to LEAD the public,” he said. “They do not know what is possible.” Even back in the command-and-control days of the production line, Henry Ford’s decision to manufacture automobiles was driven by intuition rather than market research. “If we had asked the public what they wanted,” he explained, “they would have said ‘faster horses.’”
>
> But what if you could test your most innovative ideas BEFORE they got to market? Couldn’t testing help you protect a potential breakthrough from the “fear of stupid”? Absolutely. And if you can’t exactly PROVE that a concept will work, you can at least turn a wild guess into an educated one, and give your collaborators enough confidence to proceed. The direction of business is forward. _Good research is the least amount of information that gets you out of first gear and onto the highway_.

### The Myth of Focus Groups

> Whenever you mention audience research, people immediately think “focus group.” Yet focus groups rarely deliver any of the consensus-building clarity needed to innovate. They were originally invented to FOCUS the research, not to BE the research. When used as a decision-making tool, they cast ordinary people in the role of professionals, and tend to elicit the received wisdom of a handful of alpha-consumers who see themselves as critics—and who would probably behave differently in a real buying situation. Focus groups are particularly susceptible to something called the Hawthorne effect—the tendency for people to act differently when they know they know someone’s watching. In groups, it seems, some people just have to show off.
>
> Focus groups are good as a starting point for quantitative research. Just don’t use them to gauge sales, determine pricing, or analyze things like product design, package design, or messaging elements. What should you use instead? That depends on what you want to find out.
>
> If you need to choose among prototypes, one-on-one interviews can give you enough insight to choose with confidence. If you’re looking for an understanding of audience behavior, ethnographic observation can turn up some suggestive insights. A benefit of ethnography is that it tends to circumvent the Hawthorne effect by viewing human nature unobtrusively from the sidelines. As Yogi Berra said, “You’d be surprised by how much you can observe by watching.”

### How to Avoid Getting Skewed

> Quantitative studies, while impressive, can lead to analysis paralysis when companies try to turn them into meaningful initiatives. Somehow all those numbers cause people to focus on small, measurable improvements that don’t require any real courage, and in the end don’t make much difference. Afterwards they provide a built-in excuse: “We tried that. It didn’t work.” It didn’t work because it wasn’t powered by heart-pounding insights. It went after small problems instead of hunting big game.
>
> It’s usually better to get a rough answer to the right question than a detailed answer to the wrong question. The truth is, most large studies could be cashed in for a series of smaller, more effective ones, and still have change left over. The best studies are quick and dirty—best not only because they save time and money, but because they’re more likely to focus on one problem at a time. Why boil the ocean to make a cup of tea?

### The Swap Test

> Wanna check out the effectiveness of your brand icon? Here’s a simple test you can perform without leaving your office. Swap part of your icon—the name or the visual element—with that of a competing brand, or even a brand from another category. If the resulting icon is better, or no worse than it was, your existing icon has room for improvement. By the same token, no other company should be able to improve its icon by using part of yours. A good brand icon is like a tailored suit—it should only look good on you.
>
> A variation on the swap test is the hand test. This quick-and-dirty proof lets you check the effectiveness of ads, brochures, web pages, and other brand communications. Take any piece of visual communication and cover up your trademark with your hand. Can you tell whose piece it is? If the communication in question looks as if it could have come from any other company or brand, then it’s less than it could be. Because even without a trademark, those familiar with your brand should be able to tell who’s talking just by its “voice,” or the look and feel of the materials.

### The Concept Test

> To test a concept, create a range of prototypes of the brand element in question. You can start with as many as seven concepts, but the most thoughtful responses will come when you get it down to two or three. (Like with a presidential election, people are most comfortable choosing between two candidates, and if necessary they can handle a third.) Next, present the prototypes to at least 10 members of the real audience (not company insiders), one person at a time (not as a group). Then ask a series of questions like the ones below. Notice that nowhere in the questions will you find “Which one do you like?” It’s not about liking. It’s about understanding.
>
> A brand promise, for example, might be illuminated by questions like these: Which of these promises is most valuable to you? Which company would you expect to make a promise like this? If company X made this promise, would that make sense? What other type of promise would you expect from company X? Always follow up with “Why?” because the answer to “why” will contain the seed of the next question.
>
> You might test a brand icon with a slightly different set of questions: Which of these icons catches your eye first? What made you notice it? Does it remind you of any other icons you’ve seen? What do you think this particular icon means? If it’s really supposed to mean X, do you think one of these other choices expresses it better? And so on.

#### Getting the Right Idea

> A significant advantage of a concept test is that it costs very little and yields results in a matter of hours or days, not weeks. Often, a concept test can be conducted online, using PDFs to present the images and a telephone call to conduct the interview. This “instant” feedback lets you conduct anywhere from one to three rounds—design plus testing—in less time than it would take to conduct one large study. Are concept tests conclusive? No, because they’re not meant to be conclusive. They’re meant to be lightning rods for insight. But if you want a larger sample, you can easily expand a concept test into full-scale quantitative study, which will then have the advantage of being focused on the real issues.

#### Getting the Idea Right

> True story: I once commissioned a worldwide brand study on behalf of Apple Computer. After spending a quarter-million dollars on a 10-city worldwide quantitative study, we ended up with virtually the same results as we got from our initial one-day test. Lesson: If you can live with a little uncertainty, an inexpensive concept test will often give you ample information to turn logic into magic.

### The Field Test

> Prototypes that can be tested in a realistic situation offer the best feedback, because the mental leap from concept to reality is easier. For example, if you can test a packaging prototype on the shelf, next to the competition, using real shoppers who happen to be shopping your category, your results will be more accurate than if you conduct the test in a facility, using “incentivized” subjects who will naturally begin to think more about testing than shopping. In other words, you’ll avoid getting skewed. The field test minimizes the Hawthorne effect by adhering more closely to normal shopping patterns.

> Field tests can also be used to preview the success or failure of a new product. If the first point of contact between customer and product will be the store, then the store is where the product must first succeed. If the product comes in a package, then the package is where the product must succeed. Some of the most promising ideas have died quick and painful deaths, not because people didn’t WANT them, but because the products didn’t make sense at the point of contact. Happily, a field test can reveal fatal flaws BEFORE the product is launched, giving the team a chance to build a different package—or a different product.

### What are We Looking For?

> Testing, or validation, is the process of measuring brands against meaningful criteria. All brand expressions, from icons to actual products, need to score high in five areas of communication: distinctiveness, relevance, memorability, extendibility, and depth.
>
> DISTINCTIVENESS is the quality that causes a brand expression to stand out from competing messages. If it doesn’t stand out, the game is over. Distinctiveness often requires boldness, innovation, surprise, and clarity, not to mention courage on the part of the company. Is it clear enough and unique enough to pass the swap test?
>
> RELEVANCE asks whether a brand expression is appropriate for its goals. Does it pass the hand test? Does it grow naturally from the DNA of the brand? These are good questions, because it’s possible to be attention-getting without being relevant, like a girly calendar issued by an auto parts company.
>
> MEMORABILITY is the quality that allows people to recall the brand or brand expression when they need to. Testing for memorability is difficult, because memory proves itself over time. But testing can often reveal the presence of its drivers, such as emotion, surprise, distinctiveness, and relevance.
>
> EXTENDIBILITY measures how well a given brand expression will work across media, across cultural boundaries, and across message types. In other words, does it have legs? Can it be extended into a series if necessary? It’s surprisingly easy to create a one-off, single-use piece of communication that paints you into a corner.
>
> DEPTH is the ability to communicate with audiences on a number of levels. People, even those in the same brand tribe, connect to ideas in different ways. Some are drawn to information, others to style, and still others to emotion. There are many levels of depth, and skilled communicators are able to create connections at most of them.
>
> These are the criteria that validate brand design—they provide a reality check for break-throughs. They not only separate true innovation from mere trendiness, they dispel the doubts that can freeze companies into inaction. When managers embrace the twin disciplines of innovation and validation, the marketing department is no longer the place where breakthrough ideas go to die. It’s where they prosper and grow and multiply like magic.

## Cultivate

### The Living Brand

> Business is a process, not an entity. Successful businesses are those that continually adapt to changes in ***the marketplace, the industry, the economy, and the culture***. They behave more like organisms than organizations, shifting and growing and dividing and combining as needed. Unlike the old corporate identity paradigm that prized uniformity and consistency, the new brand paradigm sacrifices those qualities in favor of being alive and dynamic.
>
> Perfection? It never existed. Control? Fuhget-aboudit. As entrepreneurial consultant Guy Kawasaki advises his clients: “Don’t worry, be crappy.” Let the brand live, breathe, make mistakes, be human. Instead of trying to present a Teflon-smooth surface, project a three-dimensional personality, inconsistencies and all. Brands can afford to be inconsistent—as long as they don’t abandon their defining attributes. They’re like people. For example, in the morning you can wear a T-shirt, and in the evening a dress shirt. One moment you can be serious, and the next laugh out loud. Despite these apparent inconsistencies in your dress and demeanor, your friends and colleagues will still recognize you. What makes you “you” is deeper than appearances and moods. I’ll venture one step further, and say that brands that don’t project depth and humanity tend to create suspicion among customers.

If People Can Change Their Clothes to Suit The Occasion, Why Can't Brands?

> The old paradigm in which identity systems try to control the “look” of an organization only result in cardboard characters, not three-dimensional protagonists. The new paradigm calls for heroes with flaws—living brands.

### The Brand Compass

> Pass out the compasses. Every person in the company should be issued a personal shockproof brandometer—a durable set of ideas about what the brand is and what makes it tick. Because no decision, big or small, should be made without asking the million-dollar question: “Will it help or hurt the brand?”
> 
> The secret of a living brand is that it lives throughout the company, not just in the marketing department. Since branding is a process, not an entity, it can be learned, taught, replicated, and cultivated. Continuing education programs can get everyone in the company onto the same page, while seminars, workshops, and critiques can keep outside collaborators singing in tune.

### Protecting the Brand

> The growing importance of the brand has a flip side: its growing vulnerability. A failed launch, a wandering brand focus, or a whiff of scandal can damage credibility and decrease brand value. And now, thanks to globalization, bad news not only travels fast, it travels far. The Firestone tire fiasco quickly deflated the value of the Ford brand by 17%, from $36 billion down to $30 billion. And in one year alone Amazon lost 31% of its brand value in trying to extend its online book niche into an online bookmusiccameracomputerappliancebabyfurnituretoy niche—with predictable non-success. During the same period, the value of the Starbucks brand grew 32%. Why? Starbucks protected its brand as it reached its aromatic fingers further into middle-America, spreading the experience but keeping the focus tight.
>
> For brand knowledge to become imbedded throughout the organization, it has to be protected against “evaporation,” the tendency for decisional wisdom to disappear as experienced people leave the company. The long-term success of any brand depends on the constant regeneration of corporate memory. Since key people tend to stay in their positions only two to five years, the challenge is to capture brand knowledge and pass it to the next generation intact. How? With a brand education program that’s distributed throughout the company and its creative network, guaranteeing the survival of the brand, while keeping it open to feedback from the brand community.

### Where are all the CBOs?

> The more a brand becomes distributed, the more it requires strong, centralized management.
> 
> Creativity can quickly turn to chaos in the absence of adult supervision (as any parent knows). And while controlled chaos is necessary for innovation and change, uncontrolled chaos can make a brand schizophrenic and confused.
> 
> The growing need for internal stewardship has given rise to the appointment of what we might call chief brand officers, or CBOs—highly experienced professionals who manage brand collaboration at the highest corporate level. CBOs are rare birds, because they need the ability to strategize with the chief, and also inspire creativity among the troops. In effect they must form a human bridge across the brand gap, connecting the company’s left brain with its right brain, bringing business strategy in line with customer experience. A CBO is the executive who lies awake at night thinking, “How can we build the brand?”

### The Virtuous Circle

> In the last century, many companies found themselves trapped a vicious circle of R&D investment, initial market success, competitive pressure, and pricecutting, until commoditization eventually forced them out of the market.
>
> Branding creates the opposite effect—a virtuous circle. By combining logic and magic, a company can ignite a chain reaction that leads from differentiation to collaboration to innovation to validation and finally to cultivation. Built into cultivation is the mandate to question all assumptions, leapfrog the status quo, and begin the cycle again. With each turn, the company and its brand spiral higher, taking it further from commoditization and closer to the Holy Grail of marketing: a sustainable competitive advantage.

Warren Buffet calls this sustainable competitive advantage, _durable competitive advantage_.

> A brand is not a logo. A brand is not a corporate identity system. It’s a person’s gut feeling about a product, service, or company. Because it depends on others for its existence, it must become a guarantee of trustworthy behavior. Good branding makes business integral to society and creates opportunity for everyone, from the chief executive to the most distant customer.
