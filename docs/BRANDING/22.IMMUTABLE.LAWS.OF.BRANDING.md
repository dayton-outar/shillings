# Notes from 22 Immutable Laws of Branding

© 1998 Al Ries and Laura Ries

## Introduction

> Can a successful brand appeal to everybody? No. The same concept of singularity makes certain that no one brand can possibly have a universal appeal.
>
> Yet, broadening the base, widening the appeal, and extending the line are all popular trends in marketing. The same forces that try to increase a company’s market share are also the forces that undermine the power of the brand.
>
> ...
>
> Conventional marketing is based on selling when it should be based on branding. Marketing is not selling. Marketing is building a brand in the mind of the prospect. If you can build a powerful brand, you will have a powerful marketing program. If you can’t, then all the advertising, fancy packaging, sales promotion, Web designs, and public relations in the world won’t help you achieve your objective.
>
> ...
> What is accelerating this trend is the decline of selling. Selling, as a profession and as a function, is slowly sinking like the Titanic. Today most products and services are bought, not sold. And branding greatly facilitates this process. Branding “pre-sells” the product or service to the user. Branding is simply a more efficient way to sell things.


> ... In financial services, for example, companies like Charles Schwab, E*Trade, Fidelity, and Vanguard are offering direct access, cheaper commissions, and on-line customer service, giving traditional stockbrokers a run for their money.

## The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding

### 1. The Law of Expansion

> **The power of a brand is inversely proportional to its scope.**
>
> ...
>
> The emphasis in most companies is on the short term. Line extension, megabranding, variable pricing, and a host of other sophisticated marketing techniques are being used to milk brands rather than build them. While milking may bring in easy money in the short term, in the long term it wears down the brand until it no longer stands for anything.
>
> ...
>
> Levi Strauss has done the same with blue jeans. In order to appeal to a wider market, Levi introduced a plethora of different styles and cuts, including baggy, zippered, and wide-leg jeans. At one point, Levi’s jeans were available in twenty-seven different cuts. And if you could not find a pair of jeans off the rack to fit, Levi’s would even custom cut jeans to your exact measurements. Yet over the past seven years the company’s share of the denim jeans market has fallen from 31 to 19 percent.
>
> ...
>
> Many companies try to justify line extension by invoking the masterbrand, superbrand, or megabrand concept.
>  - Chevrolet is the megabrand and Camaro, Caprice, Cavalier, Corsica-Beretta, Corvette, Lumina, Malibu, Metro, Monte Carlo, and Prizm are the individual brands.
>  - Pontiac is the megabrand and Bonneville, Firebird, Grand Am, Grand Prix, and Sunfire are the individual brands.
>  - Buick is the megabrand and Century, LeSabre, Park Avenue, and Regal are the individual brands.
>
> But people don’t think this way. In their minds, most people try to assign one brand name to each product. And they are not consistent in how they assign such names. They tend to use the name that best captures the essence of the product. It could be the megabrand name. Or the model name. Or a nickname.
>
> Marketers constantly run branding programs that are in conflict with how people want to perceive their brands. Customers want brands that are narrow in scope and are distinguishable by a single word, the shorter the better.

Is this still happening today where marketers are out of touch with the customers?

> If your competition is weak or nonexistent, you can often increase sales by weakening your brand. That is, by expanding it over more segments of the market. You can therefore draw the conclusion that line extension works.
> 
> But in so doing, the only thing you have demonstrated is the weakness of the competition. Coca-Cola had nothing to lose when it launched Diet Coke, because the competition (Pepsi-Cola) also had a line-extended product called Diet Pepsi.
> 
> While extending the line might bring added sales in the short term, it runs counter to the notion of branding. If you want to build a powerful brand in the minds of consumers, you need to contract your brand, not expand it.
>
> In the long term, expanding your brand will diminish your power and weaken your image.

### 2. The Law of Contraction

> **A brand becomes stronger when you narrow its focus.**
>
> Every small town in America has a coffee shop. In larger cities and towns you can often find coffee shops on every other block.
>
> So what can you find to eat in a coffee shop? Everything. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. Pancakes, muffins, hot dogs, hamburgers, sandwiches, pie, ice cream, and, of course, coffee.
>
> What did Howard Schultz do? In an incredible burst of business creativity, he opened a coffee shop that specialized in, of all things, coffee. In other words, he narrowed the focus.
> 
> Today Schultz’s brainchild, Starbucks, is a rapidly growing chain that does hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of business annually. His company, Starbucks Corp., is worth $8.7 billion on the stock market. And Howard Schultz owns a substantial share of that stock.
>
> ...
> 
> Charles Lazarus owned one store, called Children’s Supermart, which sold two things: children’s furniture and toys. But he wanted to grow.
>
> What is the conventional way to grow? Adding more things to sell. Sure, he could have added bicycles, baby food, diapers, and children’s clothing to the store. But he didn’t.
> 
> Instead, Charles Lazarus threw out the furniture and focused on toys.
>
> Good things happen when you contract your brand rather than expand it. First he filled the empty half of the store with more toys, giving the buyer a greater selection and more reason to visit the store. Then, instead of calling it Children’s Supermart, Lazarus called his place Toys “R” Us.
>
> Today Toys “R” Us sells 20 percent of all the toys sold in the United States. And the chain has become the model for the specialty stores or category killers on the retail scene. Home Depot in home supplies. The Gap in everyday casual clothing. The Limited in clothes for working women. Victoria’s Secret in ladies’ lingerie. PetsMart in pet supplies. Blockbuster Video in video rentals. CompUSA in computers. Foot Locker in athletic shoes.
>
> ...
>
> Good things happen when you contract rather than expand your business. Most retail category killers follow the same five-step pattern.
> 
> 1. Narrow the focus. A powerful branding program always starts by contracting the category, not expanding it.
> 2. Stock in depth. A typical Toys “R” Us store carries 10,000 toys versus 3,000 toys for a large department store.
> 3. Buy cheap. Toys “R” Us makes its money buying toys, not selling toys.
> 4. Sell cheap. When you can buy cheap, you can sell cheap and still maintain good margins.
> 5. Dominate the category. The ultimate objective of any branding program is to dominate a category.

### 3. The Law of Publicity

> **The birth of a brand is achieved with publicity, not advertising.**
>
> ... Most marketers confuse brand building with brand maintenance. While a hefty advertising budget might be needed to maintain high-flying brands like McDonald’s and Coca-Cola, advertising generally won’t get a new brand off the ground.
>
> Anita Roddick built The Body Shop into a major brand with no advertising at all. Instead she traveled the world on a relentless quest for publicity, pushing her ideas about the environment. It was the endless torrent of newspaper and magazine articles, plus radio and television interviews, that literally created The Body Shop brand.
>
> ...
>
> And just how do you generate publicity? The best way to generate publicity is by being first. In other words, by being the first brand in a new category.
>  - Band-Aid, the first adhesive bandage
>  - Charles Schwab, the first discount stockbrokerage firm
>  - CNN, the first cable news network
>  - Compaq, the first portable personal computer
>  - Domino’s, the first home delivery pizza chain
>  - ESPN, the first cable sports network
>  - Gore-Tex, the first breathable waterproof cloth
>  - Heineken, the first imported beer
>  - Hertz, the first car-rental company
>  - Intel, the first microprocessor
>  - Jell-O, the first gelatin dessert
>  - Kentucky Fried Chicken, the first fast-food chicken chain
>  - National Enquirer, the first supermarket tabloid
>  - Playboy, the first men’s magazine
>  - Q-Tips, the first cotton swab
>  - Reynolds Wrap, the first aluminum foil
>  - Rollerblade, the first in-line skate
>  - Samuel Adams, the first microbrewed beer
>  - Saran Wrap, the first plastic food wrap
>  - Sun Microsystems, the first Unix workstation
>  - Time, the first weekly news magazine
>  - Xerox, the first plain-paper copier
>
> All of these brands (and many, many more) were first in a new category and, in the process, generated enormous amounts of publicity.
>
> There’s a strong relationship between the two. The news media wants to talk about what’s new, what’s first, and what’s hot, not what’s better. When your brand can make news, it has a chance to generate publicity. And the best way to make news is to announce a new category, not a new product.
>
> What others say about your brand is much more powerful than what you say about it yourself. That’s why publicity in general is more effective than advertising. And why, over the past two decades, public relations has eclipsed advertising as the most effective force in branding.

### 4. The Law of Advertising

> **Once born, a brand needs advertising to stay healthy**
>
> Your advertising budget is like a country’s defense budget. Those massive advertising dollars don’t buy you anything; they just keep you from losing market share to your competition.
>
> ...
> Publicity is a powerful tool, but sooner or later a brand outlives its publicity potential. The process normally goes through two distinct phases.
>
> Phase one involves the introduction of the new category—the plain-paper copier, for example, introduced by Xerox in 1959. Hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles were written about the launch of the 914 copier. Xerox executives also appeared on numerous television shows to demonstrate their new baby. Much was written about the potential of the new category.
>
> Phase two concerns the rise of the company that pioneered the new category. Again, hundreds of articles were written about the marketing and financial successes of Xerox, a company that rose from the ashes of Haloid, a manufacturer of photographic paper.
>
> Today, everybody knows that Xerox pioneered xerography and has become a global leader in copiers. There’s no news story left to tell, so advertising takes over.
>
> ...
>
> Sooner or later a leader has to shift its branding strategy from publicity to advertising. By raising the price of admission, advertising makes it difficult for a competitor to carve out a substantial share of the market.
>
> ...
>
> Leaders should not look on their advertising budgets as investments that will pay dividends. Instead leaders should look on their advertising budgets as insurance that will protect them against losses caused by competitive attacks.
>
> What should a brand leader advertise? Brand leadership, of course. Leadership is the single most important motivating factor in consumer behavior.
>  - Heinz, America’s favorite ketchup
>  - Budweiser, king of beers
>  - Coca-Cola, the real thing
>  - Visa, it’s everywhere you want to be
>  - Barilla, Italy’s #1 pasta
>  - Goodyear, #1 in tires
>
> ...
> But what happens when your advertising says, “Our product is better”? What does the reader, the viewer, or the listener to the advertisement really think when you make the claim that you produce a better product?
>
> “That’s what they all say.”
>
> Pick up a copy of any magazine or newspaper and flip through the advertisements. Almost every ad makes some type of better-product claim. That’s what they all say.
>
> But what happens when your advertising says, “Our product is the leader”? What does the prospect think?
>
> “It must be better.”
>
> ...
>
> Advertising may not pay for itself, but if you’re the leader, advertising will make your competitor pay through the nose for the privilege of competing with you. Many won’t be able to afford it; those who can won’t bother. Instead they’ll be content to nibble on the crumbs around your huge piece of the pie.

### 5. The Law of the Word

> **A brand should strive to own a word in the mind of the consumer.**
>
> ...
>
> Volvo owns the word “safety” in the mind of the automobile buyer. And, as a result, over the past decade Volvo has become the largest-selling European luxury car in America.
> 
> ...
>
> Yet none of these three brands (Mercedes, Volvo, and BMW) is a perfect example of the law of the word since they have all recently violated the law. Mercedes has moved into less expensive, less prestigious cars. Volvo into sporty cars. And BMW into more luxurious cars.
>
> And so it goes. The minute a brand begins to stand for something in the mind, the company that owns the brand looks for ways to broaden the base, to get into other markets, to capture other attributes. This is a serious error and one of the most common mistakes in branding.
>
> ...
> Why don’t the many varieties of tissue dilute the Kleenex brand? Because when a person looks across a room, sees a box of Scott tissue, and says: “Please hand me a Kleenex,” you know you have a solid brand locked into the mind of the consumer.
> 
> In the same way that Kleenex owns tissue, Jell-O owns gelatin dessert, Coca-Cola owns cola, Band-Aid owns adhesive bandage, Saran Wrap owns plastic food film, and Rollerblade owns in-line skates

I think the point made is more than the word. The name of a company is used for reference but the psychological association in the minds of people is set by the reputation of the kind of consistent service it offers.

> Look at what Prego did to Ragú. For years Ragú was the leading brand of spaghetti sauce with a market share in excess of 50 percent. Like Emery Air Freight, Ragú had many different varieties.
>
> So what did Prego do? The brand narrowed its focus to one variety, “thick” spaghetti sauce. With this one type of sauce Prego won 27 percent of the market. Prego owns the word “thick” in the mind of the spaghetti sauce buyer.
>
> ...
>
> ... “Bloomberg” is a terminal that provides analytical tools as well as instant business news and stock prices. Bloomberg LP was the first company to introduce a device that would help money managers contrast and compare financial data.
>
> ...
>
> Until science figures out a way to replace human brain tissue with silicon chips, it’s a physical impossibility for most brands to go beyond a single word. Consider yourself lucky if your brand can own a word like “safety” or “driving” or “thick” or “overnight.”
> 
> Many marketers know this and they still look to expand the meanings of their brands. Why?
>
> Growth. They feel trapped in their present positions. They want to grow, so they think they have no choice but to expand their brands.
>
> ***But what works is not expanding the brand, but expanding the market***. In other words, instead of moving from overnight to two- or three-day delivery, Federal Express expanded the market for overnight delivery.
>
> ...
>
> Mercedes built the market for expensive cars by using prestige as its strategy. But you need subtlety in dealing with a word like “prestige.” Its connotations may work in brand building, but the word itself does not. It’s not that people aren’t dying to own prestige brands. They just hate to admit it.
>
> To be successful in branding a “prestige” product or service, you need to do two things:
>  1. You need to make your product or service more expensive than the competition.
>  2. You need to find a code word for prestige.
>
> ...
>
> If “what is the size of the market?” is the first question your company asks itself, then you are taking the wrong road to success.
>
> Ask not what percentage of an existing market your brand can achieve, ask how large a market your brand can create by narrowing its focus and owning a word in the mind.

## The 11 Immutable Laws of Internet Branding

### 1. The Law of Either/Or

> Does brand familiarity in the “outernet” foster interest in the Internet? A study by Forrester Research among sixteen- to twenty-two-year-olds says “no.” According to the Cambridge, Massachusetts–based firm, “Some of the hottest brands in the off-line world have no online value.”
>
> ...
>
> As a matter of fact, the magazine is not a good analogy for the Internet. Nor for that matter are radio, television, books, or newspapers. The Internet is the Internet, a unique new medium with its own unique new needs and requirements. Building a brand on the Internet cannot be done by using traditional brand-building strategies.
>
> On the Internet, you should start the brand-building process by forgetting everything you have learned in the past and asking yourself these two questions:
> 1. What works on the Internet?
> 2. What doesn’t work on the Internet?
>
> ...
>
> ***The Web should simplify many ordinary business transactions***. If you want to subscribe to Newsweek, once you are connected to your service provider you should be able to type www.newsweek.com into your browser, go to the Newsweek site, and subscribe. Inputting your name, address, and credit card or bank account number should do it. No cards falling out of the magazine, no stamps, no trips to the post office, no phone calls.
>
> ...
>
> Procter & Gamble is using the Web to sell beauty products, but not with Oil of Olay or any of its other brand names. Instead, P&G has created a new name (Reflect.com) and a new strategy. The site will allow consumers to “personalize” their selection of beauty products.
>
> How can you tell whether the Internet is a business or a medium for your brand? You need to ask yourself the following questions:
>
> 1. Is the brand tangible or intangible?
>
>    For tangible products the Internet tends to be an information medium. For intangible products, a business. Intangible products that are particularly appropriate for Internet branding include banking, insurance, stock brokerage, and the like.
>
>    We expect financial services of all types to move to the Net. The savings can be substantial. American Express estimates that it saves $1.00 every time a cardholder checks a balance on the Web rather than over the phone.
>
>    Travel is another category that is moving to the Web. In the year 2001, travelers spent $14 billion buying tickets on the Internet, amounting to 14 percent of their total airline spending
>
> 2. Is the brand fashionable or not?
>
>    For fashionable products the Internet tends to be a medium. For other products, a business. Clothing is generally fashionable, while computers are generally not. Where fashion is the primary factor, it’s difficult to imagine much business going to the Web. (Yh. But how about FashionNova and SHEIN?)
>
>    We don’t predict much success for Nordstromshoes.com, even though the site was launched with a $17 million advertising campaign. The commercials are amusing, but the prospect is unlikely to do much shoe buying on the Internet. There are three major questions a shoe site can’t answer. Will they fit? Will they look good on my feet? Are they going to be comfortable?
>
> 3. Is the product available in thousands of variations?
>
>    If so, the Internet tends to be a business. Books, for example. It’s hard for an existing retail establishment to compete in a category with a bewildering array of choices. There’s no way, for example, that a bookstore could stock all the titles available at Amazon.com.
>
>    ...
>
>    Product variation is likely to become a major battleground in an Internet-dominated economy. Excluding food stores, roughly half the people who shop at any given store today walk out without buying anything. The major reason: The store didn’t have in stock the product the customer was looking for.
>
>    If physical stores are your major distribution channel, then you need to reduce the product variety you offer. Compaq’s best response to Dell, for example, would have been to reduce its product line and promote a handful of computer products available off the shelf in retail computer stores. When you make too many variations, you can be sure that the one model the prospect wants won’t be in stock.
>
>    If the Internet is your major distribution channel, then you want to promote the wide range of models, sizes, and colors you have available.
>
> 4. Is low price a significant factor in the brand’s purchase?
>
>    If so, the Internet tends to be a business—eBay.com and Priceline.com, for example.
>
>    The ability of the buyer to quickly check prices on a large number of sites is making the Internet a very price-sensitive medium. There are even sites, like MySimon.com and DealTime.com, that will compare prices among other sites by sending out robots, or “bots,” to check the prices. Heaven help you if you don’t have a competitive price.
>
>    Because of this price pressure, one of the biggest challenges for building a brand on the Net is trying to figure out how to make money. This will be a critical issue for many brands.
>
> 5. Are shipping costs a significant factor as compared to the purchase price?
>
>    If so, the Internet tends to be a medium. Groceries, for example. Webvan has already failed and Peapod.com is struggling. It’s unlikely that any mass-market Internet site will be able to build a successful business and a successful brand selling groceries.
> 
>    The milkman used to deliver fresh milk every morning. We’re sure that many families would like their milk delivered today, but they can’t get it. Why? It’s not economical anymore.
>
>    In the Internet era, are we going to go backward? Is self-service dead? We don’t think so. Yet many marketing experts are saying the opposite. “The grocery store as we know it is going out of business,” said former Procter & Gamble brand manager Doug Hall.
>
>    Futurist Faith Popcorn goes even further. By the year 2010, she predicts, 90 percent of all consumer products will be home-delivered. “They’ll put a refrigerator in your garage and bar code your kitchen. Every week they’ll restock your favorites, without your ever having to reorder. They’ll even pick up your dry cleaning, return your videotapes, whatever you need.”
>
>    The Internet is the biggest technological development of the twentieth century, but let’s not get carried away. Just because something is possible doesn’t make it likely to occur. The grocery business has three strikes against it: 
>     1. high selection costs, that is, the costs involved in picking and packing products in the warehouse 
>     2. high delivery costs 
>     3. low margins. 
>    The average supermarket chain makes 1 or 2 percent net profit on sales.
>
> It’s hard to see how an Internet company could absorb the additional costs involved in picking, packing, and delivery and still make money in a low-margin business. A niche market, to be sure, but not a mainstream brand.
>
> Hope springs eternal. Venture capitalists doled out an astounding $275 million to launch Webvan, an Internet grocery company. In addition, the company managed to hire as its chief executive George Shaheen, the former head of Andersen Consulting (now Accenture).
>
> Some consultants claim that you need both an Internet presence and a retail presence to be successful in the future, the so-called click and mortar strategy. Otherwise, goes the argument, how could you return items you ordered on the Net? That’s one reason some experts have foolishly predicted that Barnesandnoble.com will eventually outsell Amazon.com.
>
> Don’t believe it. People don’t buy things based on how easy they are to return. It’s a factor, of course, but not the primary factor in deciding where to buy. Reputation, selection, and price are far more important. It’s impossible to build a reputation as a store with great selection and low prices if you are schizophrenic, that is, if you have both physical stores and Internet sites. All you are doing is confusing people.
>
> Will Sears.com become a big success? Unlikely.
> 
> No one factor, of course, will determine whether your brand should be a business on the Internet or whether the Net is just another medium to promote your brand. You have to carefully consider all the factors before you decide.
>
> But decide you should before some other brand beats you to the punch.
