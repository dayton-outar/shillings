# Branding Strategy

Without any knowledge and experience in branding, I decided to use the name, "shillings", to describe this stock tracking project. I decided to expand the project to reach for a bolder vision, which is global reach with a new perspective on how to learn, study and trade stocks. I read a few good books on branding and took some notes. Some of the notes from the books are found in the following references,

 - [The Brand Gap](./THE.BRAND.GAP.md)
 - [The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding](./22.IMMUTABLE.LAWS.OF.BRANDING.md)
 - [Positioning: The Battle for your Mind](./POSITIONING.md)
 - [Alchemy: The Dark Art and Curious Science of Creating Magic in Brands, Business, and Life](#the-alchemy)
   - Signalling, Satisficing and Psycho-physics

The word "shillings" is not generic but rather a specific term related to currency. "Shillings" has been used as a form of currency in various countries, and the term is not limited to a single region. However, the specific value and usage of shillings can vary from one country to another. It's important to note that many countries have transitioned to other forms of currency and no longer use shillings. It's important to note that it is still used in Kenya and Kenya has a stock exchange called [Nairobi Securities Exchange](https://www.nse.co.ke/).

## Positioning

"Shillings" does not convey a strong enough appeal to captivate a place in the minds of people to position it as an _immersive_ stock trading platform. So, the question raised from this is, how can we choose a name that will take the place in the minds of the people, where this project (or product) is the _first_ thing that comes to their mind when they want to get _real-time_ analytics of stock trading presented in a visually appealing and cohesive manner?

We want our customers to _have fun while making money, studying businesses and trading stocks_. This project is a _playground_ for investors. It brings a gaming type of experience, where they get _the right amount of information on demand and at the right time_. It is a, _hub_, a _central_ repository of all information related to stocks showing all the important and profitable relationships between the players within the stock market industry.

The _immersive_ experience is an appeal to develop this project in a way where users can _learn quickly_ and _improve their intelligence_ as they develop a _habit_ of visiting the project on a regular basis (at least weekly but hopefully daily) to grow their insights and to win the game of stock trading.

## The Name

For a catchy name to captivate the minds of our customers, we need to operate within the following parameters:

1. The name must have at most: 2 syllables
2. The name must be easy to spell
3. The name must be as short as possible
4. The name must not be initials (like IBM)

A few ideas for new name include,
 - ching (1 syllable)
 - jingle (2 syllables)
 - moneypot (the name maybe too generic; 3 syllables)
 - Stock Ping
 - Stock Riot
 - Stong
 - Stockpile
 - Jing
 - Gimbl (nothing wrong with creating a new name like what Google did)
 - Stock Bong
 - Stock Hub
 - Stock Central
 - Stock Bib
 - Stock Tip
 - Stock Deck
 - Haffi (Cause we _haffi_ make money)

Here's a helpful tip. Upon sharing the need to rebrand to Owin Watson, he agreed that the product need to be rebranded, especially that the current name suggest little money. The name, 'shillings', in Jamaica expresses meagre funds in daily conversation in the past. The word is still used as of this writing in the same manner. So, should we make up a name that expresses opulence? (If a new name is made, that name will need public relations to make it take hold in the minds of people)

## The Avatar

Marty Neumeier in his book, _The Brand Gap_, encourages entrepreneurs to make use of avatars. Pillsbury has their avatar as the doughboy. Aflac has the duck. Kellog's has the tiger for their frosted flakes.

> Logos are dead! Long live icons and avatars! Why? Because logos as we know them—logo-types, monograms, abstract symbols, and other two-dimensional trademarks—are products of the printing press and mass communication. They evolved as a way to identify brands rather than to differentiate them. Today marketers realize that branding is not about stamping a trademark on anything that moves. It’s about managing relationships between the company and its constituents, conducting a conversation among many people over many channels. We still have the printing press at our beck and call, but we also have the Internet, TV, telemarketing, live events, and other media to work with. Icons and avatars respond to this new reality by jumping off the printed page and interacting with people wherever they are.

An appropriate avatar can provide inspiration for logos and be used in bringing the immersive experience to the trading platform. Avatars work well in advertising.

In the event that we need to build logos, we can try [BrandCrowd](https://www.brandcrowd.com/).

## The Tagline

Taglines are a brief and to the point statement that communicates the product's essence to the customer. It's perfect for advertisement. Since, initially this project will start with a _small viable market_, and publicize through the different target communicates, the tagline is not mandatory or critical at the moment.

As the project picks up traction, we can determine an appropriate tagline.

## The Experience

The brand is at the very core, the experience that we promise to provide to them.

## The Alchemy

Rory Sutherland's "Alchemy" delves into several nuanced concepts, including signaling, satisficing, and psychophysics, which play critical roles in understanding consumer behavior and crafting effective marketing strategies. Here’s a closer look at these concepts as presented in the book:

### Signaling

**Signaling** refers to the actions taken by individuals or organizations to convey information indirectly through behaviors, choices, and attributes rather than direct communication. In marketing and business, signaling is about creating impressions that communicate value, trustworthiness, or other desirable qualities.

- **Luxury Brands**: Luxury brands often use high prices as a signal of quality and exclusivity. The higher cost implies superior craftsmanship and status, attracting consumers who seek these attributes.
- **Behavioral Signals**: Businesses might adopt environmentally friendly practices not only to benefit the environment but also to signal corporate responsibility and attract like-minded consumers.
- **Non-Obvious Signals**: Sutherland emphasizes that signals do not always need to be overt. Subtle cues, such as packaging design or customer service quality, can significantly influence perceptions.

### Satisficing

**Satisficing** is a decision-making strategy that aims for a satisfactory or adequate result rather than the optimal one. This concept, introduced by Herbert A. Simon, highlights that humans often settle for a "good enough" option rather than exhaustively searching for the best possible solution due to constraints like limited time and information.

- **Consumer Choices**: Consumers frequently satisfice rather than optimize. For example, when choosing a restaurant, people might pick one that is “good enough” based on reviews and convenience rather than analyzing every possible option.
- **Business Applications**: Companies can benefit by understanding that offering products that meet the essential criteria of consumers can be more effective than striving for perfection. This can also reduce costs and improve time-to-market.

### Psychophysics

**Psychophysics** studies the relationship between physical stimuli and the sensations and perceptions they produce. It explores how humans perceive differences in stimuli, such as changes in price, size, color, or sound, and how these perceptions influence behavior.

- **Perception of Value**: Sutherland explains how small changes in product presentation can significantly impact perceived value. For instance, the way a price is displayed (e.g., $19.99 vs. $20.00) can affect consumer perception and decision-making.
- **Just Noticeable Difference (JND)**: This concept from psychophysics is crucial in marketing. It refers to the smallest change in a stimulus that can be detected. Marketers use JND to make adjustments in product features or pricing that influence consumer behavior without being overtly noticeable.
- **Sensory Marketing**: Understanding psychophysics allows marketers to design experiences that align with human sensory perceptions. This includes everything from the color and design of packaging to the sound and feel of a product.

### Integration of Concepts

Sutherland integrates these concepts to show how businesses can create compelling value propositions and marketing strategies that resonate with consumers on a deeper psychological level. By leveraging signaling, satisficing, and psychophysics, businesses can better understand and influence consumer behavior, leading to more effective and innovative approaches to branding, advertising, and product development.

In essence, "Alchemy" suggests that by embracing these unconventional and often overlooked aspects of human behavior, marketers and business leaders can unlock new opportunities and create "magic" in their brands and strategies.
