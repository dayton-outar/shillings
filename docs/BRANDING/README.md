# Branding Strategy

Change name from shillings to,
 - ching
 - jingle

Also, thought of moneypot but maybe the name is generic.

The word "shillings" is not generic but rather a specific term related to currency. Shillings have been used as a form of currency in various countries, and the term is not limited to a single region. However, the specific value and usage of shillings can vary from one country to another. It's important to note that many countries have transitioned to other forms of currency and no longer use shillings.

Some countries where shillings were in use included:

1. Kenya - Kenyan Shilling (KES)
1. Tanzania - Tanzanian Shilling (TZS)
1. Uganda - Ugandan Shilling (UGX)

Confidence level: High
