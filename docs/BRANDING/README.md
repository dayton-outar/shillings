# Branding Strategy

Without any knowledge and experience in branding, I decided to use the name, "shillings", to describe this stock tracking project. I decided to expand the project to reach for a bolder vision, which is global reach with a new perspective on how to learn, study and trade stocks. I read a few good books on branding and took some notes. Some of the notes from the books are found in the following references,

 - [The Brand Gap](./THE.BRAND.GAP.md)
 - [The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding](./22.IMMUTABLE.LAWS.OF.BRANDING.md)
 - [Positioning: The Battle for your Mind](./POSITIONING.md)

The word "shillings" is not generic but rather a specific term related to currency. "Shillings" has been used as a form of currency in various countries, and the term is not limited to a single region. However, the specific value and usage of shillings can vary from one country to another. It's important to note that many countries have transitioned to other forms of currency and no longer use shillings. It's important to note that it is still used in Kenya and Kenya has a stock exchange called [Nairobi Securities Exchange](https://www.nse.co.ke/).

## Positioning

"Shillings" does not convey a strong enough appeal to captivate a place in the minds of people to position it as an _immersive_ stock trading platform. So, the question raised from this is, how can we choose a name that will take the place in the minds of the people, where this project (or product) is the _first_ thing that comes to their mind? When persons want a place to get _real-time_ analytics of stock trading presented in a visually appealing and cohesive manner, they think of this project. We want our customers to _have fun while making money, studying businesses and trading stocks_. This project is a _playground_ for investors. It brings a gaming type of experience, where they get _the right amount of information on demand and at the right time_. It is a, _hub_, a _central_ repository of all information related to stocks showing all the important and profitable relationships between the players within the stock market industry.

The _immersive_ experience is an appeal to develop this project in a way where users can _learn quickly_ and _improve their intelligence_ as they develop a _habit_ of visiting the project on a regular basis (at least weekly but hopefully daily) to grow their insights and to win the game of stock trading.

## The Name

For a catchy name to captivate the minds of our customers, we need to operate within the following parameters:

1. The name must have at most: 2 syllables
2. The name must be easy to spell
3. The name must be as short as possible
4. The name must not be initials (like IBM)

A few ideas for new name include,
 - ching (1 syllable)
 - jingle (2 syllables)
 - moneypot (the name maybe too generic; 3 syllables)
 - Stock Ping
 - Stock Riot
 - Stong
 - Stockpile
 - Jing
 - Gimbl (nothing wrong with creating a new name like what Google did)
 - Stock Bong
 - Stock Hub
 - Stock Central
 - Stock Bib
 - Stock Tip
 - Stock Deck

 ## The Avatar

  Marty Neumeier in his book, _The Brand Gap_, encourages entrepreneurs to make use of avatars. Pillsbury has their avatar as the doughboy. Aflac has the duck. Kellog's has the tiger for their frosted flakes.

  > Logos are dead! Long live icons and avatars! Why? Because logos as we know them—logo-types, monograms, abstract symbols, and other two-dimensional trademarks—are products of the printing press and mass communication. They evolved as a way to identify brands rather than to differentiate them. Today marketers realize that branding is not about stamping a trademark on anything that moves. It’s about managing relationships between the company and its constituents, conducting a conversation among many people over many channels. We still have the printing press at our beck and call, but we also have the Internet, TV, telemarketing, live events, and other media to work with. Icons and avatars respond to this new reality by jumping off the printed page and interacting with people wherever they are.

  An appropriate avatar can provide inspiration for logos and be used in bringing the immersive experience to the trading platform. Avatars work well in advertising.

  ## The Tagline

  Taglines are a brief and to the point statement that communicates the product's essence to the customer. It's perfect for advertisement. Since, initially this project will start with a _small viable market_, and publicize through the different target communicates, the tagline is not mandatory or critical at the moment.

  As the project picks up traction, we can determine an appropriate tagline.

  ## The Experience

  The brand is at the very core, the experience that we promise to provide to them.
