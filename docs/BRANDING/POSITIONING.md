# Positioning: The Battle for your Mind

© 2001 Jack Trout and Al Ries

## Introduction

> We have become the world’s first overcommunicated society. Each year, we send more and receive less.
>
> ...
>
> Positioning starts with a product. A piece of merchandise, a service, a company, an institution, or even a person. Perhaps yourself.
> 
> But positioning is not what you do to a product. Positioning is what you do to the mind of the prospect. That is, you position the product in the mind of the prospect.
>
> So it’s incorrect to call the concept “product positioning.” You’re not really doing something to the product itself.
>
> Not that positioning doesn’t involve change. It often does. But changes made in the name, the price, and the package are really not changes in the product at all. They’re basically cosmetic changes done for the purpose of securing a worthwhile position in the prospect’s mind.
> 
> Positioning is the first body of thought that comes to grips with the difficult problem of getting heard in our overcommunicated society.

## Chapter 1. What Positioning is All About

> In the communication jungle out there, the only hope to score big is to be selective, to concentrate on narrow targets, to practice segmentation. In a word, “positioning.”
> 
> The mind, as a defense against the volume of today’s communications, screens and rejects much of the information offered it. In general, the mind accepts only that which matches prior knowledge or experience.
>
> ...
>
> In other words, since so little of your message is going to get through anyway, you ignore the sending side and concentrate on the receiving end. You concentrate on the perceptions of the prospect. Not the reality of the product.

## Chapter 2. The Assault on the Mind

> The Sunday edition of a large metropolitan newspaper like The New York Times weighs about 4½ pounds and contains some 500,000 words. To read it all, at an average reading speed of 300 words per minute, would take almost 28 hours. Not only would your Sunday be shot, but also a good part of the rest of the week too.
> 
> How much is getting through?
>
> ...
> 
> Which means the average American family is exposed to some 750,000 television pictures a day.
>
> Not only are we being pictured to death, we are being papered to death. Take that Xerox machine down the hall. American business processes 1.4 trillion pieces of paper a year. That’s 5.6 billion every working day.
>
> ...
>
> The assault on the mind takes place in many different ways. The U.S. Congress passes some 500 laws a year (that’s bad enough), but regulatory agencies promulgate some 10,000 new rules and regulations in the same amount of time.
> 
> And the regulatory agencies are not stingy with their words either. Consider this: The Lord’s Prayer contains 56 words; the Gettysburg Address, 266; the Ten Commandments, 297; the Declaration of Independence, 300; and a recent U.S. government order setting the price of cabbage, 26,911.
> 
> At the state level, over 250,000 bills are introduced each year. And 25,000 pass the legislatures to disappear into the labyrinths of the law.
> 
> Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Ignorance of the lawmakers apparently is. Our legislators continue to pass thousands of laws that you can’t possibly keep track of. And even if you could, you couldn’t possibly remember how a law might differ from one of our 50 states to another.
> 
> Who reads, sees, or listens to all this outpouring of communication?
> 
> There’s a traffic jam on the turnpikes of the mind. Engines are overheating. Tempers are rising.

## Chapter 3. Getting into the Mind

> The easy way to get into a person’s mind is to be first. You can demonstrate the validity of this principle by asking yourself a few simple questions.
>
> What’s the name of the first person to fly solo across the North Atlantic? Charles Lindbergh, right?
>
> Now, what’s the name of the second person to fly solo across the North Atlantic?

Hmm. I'm not too sure. But, I'm allowing this argument to play out.

> What’s the name of the highest mountain in the world? Mount Everest in the Himalayas, right?

Well, yeah. I definitely know this one.

> Not so in a mental contest. In a mental battle the odds favor the first person, the first product, the first politician to get into the mind of the prospect.
> 
> In advertising, the first product to establish the position has an enormous advantage. Xerox, Polaroid, Bubble Yum, to name a few more examples.
>
> ...
> 
> Today it has become obvious that advertising is entering a new era—an era where creativity is no longer the key to success.
> 
> The fun and games of the sixties and seventies have given way to the harsh realities of the eighties.
> 
> To succeed in our overcommunicated society, a company must create a position in the prospect’s mind, a position that takes into consideration not only a company’s own strengths and weaknesses, but those of its competitors as well.
> 
> Advertising is entering an era where strategy is king. In the positioning era, it’s not enough to invent or discover something. It may not even be necessary. You must, however, be first to get into the prospect’s mind.
>
> IBM didn’t invent the computer. Sperry-Rand did. But IBM was the first company to build a computer position in the mind of the prospect.
> 
> ...
>
> “First class is Michelob” positioned the brand as a premium-priced American-made beer. In a few years, Michelob became one of the largest-selling beers in the United States. At premium prices too.
> 
> Was Michelob the first premium-priced domestic beer? No, of course not. But Michelob was the first to build the position in the beer-drinker’s mind.

## Chapter 4. Those Little Ladders in Your Head

> The mind rejects new information that doesn’t “compute.” It accepts only that new information which matches its current state of mind. It filters out everything else.
>
> ...
>
> Ask two people of opposite persuasion, say, a Democrat and a Republican, to read an article on a controversial subject. Then ask each one if the article changed his or her opinion.
> 
> You’ll find that the Democrat gets out of the article facts to support one point of view. The Republican gets out of the same article facts to support the opposite point of view. Very little mind changing takes place. You see what you expect to see.
>
> ...
> 
> You taste what you expect to taste.
>
> Blind taste testings of champagne have often ranked inexpensive California brands above French ones. With the labels on, this is unlikely to happen.
> 
> You taste what you expect to taste.
>
> ...
>
> One prime objective of all advertising is to heighten expectations. To create the illusion that the product or service will perform the miracles you expect. And presto, that’s exactly what the advertising does.
>
> But create the opposite expectation and the product is in trouble. The introductory advertising for Gablinger’s beer created a feeling that because it was a diet product, it would taste bad.
>
> And sure enough, the advertising worked! People tried it and were easily convinced that it did taste bad. You taste what you expect to taste.
>
> ...
> 
> According to Harvard psychologist Dr. George A. Miller, the average human mind cannot deal with more than seven units at a time. Which is why seven is a popular number for lists that have to be remembered. Seven-digit phone numbers, the Seven Wonders of the World, seven-card stud, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
> 
> Ask someone to name all the brands he or she remembers in a given product category. Rarely will anyone name more than seven. And that’s for a high-interest category. For low-interest products, the average consumer can usually name no more than one or two brands.
> 
> ...
> 
> A competitor that wants to increase its share of the business must either dislodge the brand above (a task that is usually impossible) or somehow relate its brand to the other company’s position.
>
> ...
> 
> An advertiser who wants to introduce a new product category must carry in a new ladder. This, too, is difficult, especially if the new category is not positioned against the old one. The mind has no room for what’s new and different unless it’s related to the old.
> 
> That’s why if you have a truly new product, it’s often better to tell the prospect what the product is not, rather than what it is.
> 
> The first automobile, for example, was called a “horseless” carriage, a name which allowed the public to position the concept against the existing mode of transportation.
> 
> Words like “off-track” betting, “lead-free” gasoline, and “sugar-free” soda are all examples of how new concepts can best be positioned against the old.
>
> ...
> 
> “Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars, so why go with us? We try harder.”
>
> For 13 years in a row, Avis lost money. Then they admitted that they were No. 2 and Avis started to make money.
>
> ...
> 
> On each rung of the product ladder is a brand name. Hertz on top. Avis on the second rung. National on the third.
> 
> Many marketing people have misread the Avis story. They assume the company was successful because it tried harder.
> 
> Not at all. Avis was successful because it related itself to Hertz. (If trying harder were the secret of success, Harold Stassen would have been President many times over.)
>
> ...
> 
> Establishing the “against” position is a classic positioning maneuver. If a company isn’t the first, then it has to be the first to occupy the No. 2 position. It’s not an easy task.
> 
> But it can be done. What Avis is doing in rent-a-cars, Burger King is doing in fast foods, and Pepsi is doing in colas.
> 
> ...
> 
> By linking the product to what was already in the mind of the prospect, the “uncola” position established 7-Up as an alternative to a cola drink. (The three rungs on the cola ladder might be visualized as: One, Coke. Two, Pepsi, And three, 7-Up.)
>
> ...
> 
> To find a unique position, you must ignore conventional logic. Conventional logic says you find your concept inside yourself or inside the product.
> 
> Not true. What you must do is look inside the prospect’s mind.
> 
> You won’t find an “uncola” idea inside a 7-Up can. You find it inside the cola drinker’s head.
>
> More than anything else, successful positioning requires consistency. You must keep at it year after year.
>
> Yet after a company has executed a brilliant positioning coup, too often it falls into what we call the F.W.M.T.S. trap: “Forgot what made them successful.”
> 
> Shortly after the company was sold to ITT, Avis decided it was no longer satisfied with being No. 2. So it ran ads saying, “Avis is going to be No. 1.”
> 
> That’s advertising your aspirations. Wrong psychologically. And wrong strategically.
> 
> Avis was not destined to be No. 1 unless it could find a weakness in Hertz to exploit.
> 
> Furthermore, the old campaign not only related No. 2 Avis to No. 1 Hertz on the product ladder in the prospect’s mind, but also capitalized on the natural sympathy people have for the underdog.
> 
> The new campaign was just conventional brag-and-boast advertising.

## Chapter 5. You Can't Get There from Here

> Today a company can have a great product, a great sales force, a great advertising campaign and still fail miserably if it happens to be in a position in which “you can’t get there from here.” No matter how many millions it is prepared to spend.
>
> ...
>
> A better strategy for IBM’s competitors would be to take advantage of whatever positions they already own in the minds of their prospects and then relate them to a new position in computers. For example, how should RCA have positioned its computer line?
> 
> Our 1969 article made a suggestion: “RCA is a leader in communications. If they positioned a computer line that related to their business in communications, they could take advantage of their own position. Even though they would be ignoring a great deal of business, they would be establishing a strong beachhead.”
>
> ...
>
> NCR has made great progress in the computer business by concentrating its efforts on retail data entry systems. Computerized cash registers, if you will.
> 
> Where the situation is hopeless, however, the effort in finding a valid position is probably wasted. Much better to concentrate on other areas of a company’s business. As Charlie Brown said, “No problem is too big to run away from.”

## Chapter 6. Positioning of a Leader

> Companies like Avis and Seven-Up found viable alternative positions to marketing leaders.
> 
> But most companies don’t want to be an also-ran, successful or not. They want to be a leader like Hertz or Coke.
> 
> So how do you get to be the leader? Actually it’s quite simple. Remember Charles Lindbergh and Neil Armstrong?
> 
> You just get there firstest with the mostest.
> 
> History shows that the first brand into the brain, on the average, gets twice the long-term market share of the No. 2 brand and twice again as much as the No. 3 brand. And the relationships are not easily changed.
> 
> The leader brand in category after category outsells the number two brand by a wide margin. Hertz outsells Avis, General Motors outsells Ford, Goodyear outsells Firestone, McDonald’s outsells Burger King, General Electric outsells Westinghouse.
> 
> Many marketing experts overlook the enormous advantages of being first. Too often they attribute successes like Kodak and IBM and Coke to “marketing acumen.”
>
> ...
>
> As long as a company owns the position, there’s no point in running advertisements that repeat the obvious. “We’re No. 1” is a typical example.
> 
> Much better is to enhance the product category in the prospect’s mind. IBM’s advertising usually ignores competition and sells the value of computers. All computers, not just the company’s types.
> 
> Why isn’t it a good idea to run advertising that says, “We’re No. 1”?
> 
> The reason is psychological. Either the prospect knows you are No. 1 and wonders why you are so insecure that you have to say so. Or the prospect doesn’t know you are No. 1. If not, why not?
> 
> ...
> 
> “The real thing.” This classic Coca-Cola advertising campaign is a strategy that can work for any leader.
> 
> The essential ingredient in securing the leadership position is getting into the mind first. The essential ingredient in keeping that position is reinforcing the original concept. Coca-Cola is the standard by which all others are judged. In contrast, everything else is an imitation of “the real thing.”
> 
> This is not the same as saying “We’re No. 1.” The largest brand could be the largest seller because it has a lower price, it is available in more outlets, etc.
> 
> But “the real thing,” like a first love, will always occupy a special place in the prospect’s mind.
> 
> “We invented the product.” A powerful motivating force behind Xerox copiers. Polaroid cameras. Zippo lighters.
>
> ...
>
> This means a leader should swallow his or her pride and adopt every new product development as soon as it shows signs of promise.
> 
> General Motors spent $50 million to cover the Wankel engine when it was offered to the automotive industry. Money down the drain? Not necessarily.
> 
> General Motors probably looks on the $50 million spent to buy a Wankel license as cheap insurance to protect an $84 billion-a-year business.
> 
> Suppose the Wankel had become the automotive engine of the future. And Ford or Chrysler had been the first to buy the rights. Where would General Motors be now?
> 
> Right where Kodak and 3M are in office copiers. When these two leaders in coated-paper copiers had a chance to cover by buying rights to Carlson’s xerography process, they declined.
> 
> “Nobody would pay 5 cents for a plain-paper copy when they could get a coated-paper copy for a cent and a half.” Logical enough. But the essence of covering is protection against the unexpected.
> 
> And the unexpected did happen. Haloid took a chance on the Carlson patents, and today the company (successively Haloid Xerox and then Xerox) is a $9 billion giant. Bigger than 3M and only a step behind Kodak. Fortune calls the Xerox 914 plain-paper copier “probably the single most profitable product ever manufactured in the United States.”
> 
> And what did Xerox do for an encore?
> 
> Almost nothing. The spectacular success of the 914 was followed by one failure after another. Most notably in computers.
>
> ...
> 
> ***The power of the organization is derived from the power of the product, the position that the product owns in the prospect’s mind.***
>
> ...
> 
> Each brand is uniquely positioned to occupy a certain location in the mind of the prospect. When times change, when new products come and go, no effort is made to change the position. Rather a new product is introduced to reflect changing technologies and changing tastes.
> 
> In other words, Procter & Gamble recognizes the enormous difficulty of moving an established position. When you have one already established, why change it? It may be cheaper and more effective in the long run to introduce a new product. Even if you eventually have to kill off an old, established name.
>
> Ivory was a soap. It still is. When heavy-duty laundry detergents became available, the pressure was probably on to introduce Ivory Detergent. But this would have meant changing the position of Ivory in the prospect’s mind.
> 
> A much better solution was Tide. Now the new detergent concept had a new name to match. And Tide became an enormous success.
> 
> And when Procter & Gamble introduced a dishwasher detergent, they didn’t call it Dishwasher Tide. They called it Cascade.
> 
> Each leading Procter & Gamble brand has its own separate identity: Joy, Crest, Head & Shoulders, Sure, Bounty, Pampers, Comet, Charmin, and Duncan Hines. Not a Plus, Ultra, or Super in the lot.

## Chapter 7. Positioning of a Follower

> What works for a leader doesn’t necessarily work for a follower. Leaders can often cover a competitive move and retain their leadership.
> 
> But followers are not in the same position to benefit from a covering strategy. When a follower copies a leader, it’s not covering at all. It’s better described as a me-too response. (Usually phrased more diplomatically as “keeping in tune with the times.”)
> 
> Most products fail to achieve reasonable sales goals because the accent is on “better” rather than “speed.” That is, the No. 2 company thinks the road to success is to introduce a me-too product, only better.
> 
> It’s not enough to be better than the competitor. You must introduce your product before someone else has a chance to establish leadership. With a more massive advertising and promotion launch. And a better name. (More on this point later.)
>
> Yet the opposite normally occurs. The me-too company wastes valuable time on improving the product. Then the launch is made with a smaller advertising budget than the leader’s. And then the new product is given the house name, because that’s the easy way to ensure a quick share of market. All deadly traps in our overcommunicated society.
>
> How do you find an open position in the prospect’s mind?
>
> The French have a marketing expression that sums up this strategy rather neatly.
>
> Cherchez le creneau. “Look for the hole.”
>
> Cherchez le creneau and then fill it.
>
> That advice goes against the “bigger and better” philosophy ingrained into the American spirit.
> 
> Another typically American attitude makes positioning thinking difficult. Ever since childhood, we have been taught to think in a certain way.
> 
> “The power of positive thinking,” Norman Vincent Peale called it. An attitude which may sell a lot of books but which can destroy a person’s ability to find a creneau.
> 
> To find a creneau, you must have the ability to think in reverse, to go against the grain. If everyone else is going east, see if you can find your creneau by going west. A strategy that worked for Christopher Columbus can also work for you.
> 
> Let’s explore some strategies for finding creneaus.

### The size creneau

> For years, Detroit automakers were on a longer, lower kick. Each model year, cars became more streamlined, better looking.
> 
> Enter the Volkswagen Beetle. Short, fat, and ugly.
> 
> The conventional way to promote the Beetle would have been to minimize the weaknesses and maximize the strengths.
> 
> “Let’s get a fashion photographer who can make the car look better than it is. Then we’ll play up the reliability angle,” is your ordinary strategy.
> 
> But the creneau was size. The most effective ad Volkswagen ever ran was the one which stated the position clearly and unequivocally.
> 
> “Think small.”
> 
> With two simple words, this headline did two things at once. It stated the Volkswagen position, and it challenged the prospect’s assumption that bigger is necessarily better.
> 
> The effectiveness of this approach, of course, depends on the existence of an open creneau in the prospect’s mind. Not that there weren’t other small cars on the market at the time the Beetle was introduced. There were, but no one else had preempted the small-car position.

### The high-price creneau

> The classic example is Michelob. The people at Anheuser-Busch found an untapped market for a premium-priced domestic beer. And they moved into the mind with the Michelob name.
> 
> High-price creneaus seem to be opening up in many product categories. As our throwaway society sees the urgent need for conversation, there’s a new appreciation of a quality product designed to last.
> 
> Which is one reason behind the success of $40,000 automobiles like the BMW 635-CS and $50,000 cars like the Mercedes-Benz 500-SEL.
> 
> And S. T. Dupont (nice name) lighters at, as the ads say, “$1500 and down.”
> 
> Price is an advantage, especially if you’re the first in the category to establish the high-price creneau.
>
> ...
> 
> High price is effective not only for luxury items like cars, perfume, and watches, but also mundane products like Whitney’s Yogurt and Orville Redenbacher’s Gourmet Popping Corn.

### The low-price creneau

> Instead of high price, the opposite direction can also be a profitable tack to take.
>
> In evaluating price as a possible creneau, keep in mind that the low-price creneau is often a good choice for new products like facsimile equipment and videotape players. Products customers believe they are taking a chance on. (If the thing doesn’t work right, I’m not out that much money.)
> 
> The high-price creneau is often a good choice for old, established products like automobiles, watches, and television sets. Especially those products for which customers are not happy with existing repair services.
>
> The recent introduction of generic (“no name”) food brands is an attempt to exploit the low-price creneau in the supermarket. (Although retailer emphasis on sales and low prices over the years have pretty much wiped out the opportunities in that direction.)

### The gender-biased creneau

> Sex is one. Marlboro was the first national brand to establish a masculine position in cigarettes, one reason why Phillip Morris’s Marlboro brand has climbed steadily in sales. From fifth place in sales to first place in a 10-year period.
> 
> Timing is critical. In 1973 Lorillard tried to introduce its own masculine brand called Luke. The name was terrific, the packaging was great, the advertising was brilliant. “From Kankakee to Kokomo along comes Luke movin’ free and slow.”
> 
> The only thing wrong was the timing. About 20 years too late. Luke really was movin’ slow, so Lorillard killed him.
> 
> In positioning a product, there’s no substitute for getting there first.
>
> ...
> 
> When you use sex to segment a product category and establish a position, the obvious approach isn’t always the best.
> 
> Take perfume, for example. You’d think that the more delicate and feminine the brand, the more successful it would be. So what’s the largest-selling brand of perfume in the world?
> 
> No, it’s not Arpege or Chanel No. 5. It’s Revlon’s Charlie. The first brand to try a masculine name complete with pantsuit ads.

### The age-biased creneau

> Age is another positioning strategy to use. Geritol tonic is a good example of a successful product aimed at older folks.
> 
> Aim toothpaste is a good example of a product aimed at children. Aim has carved out 10 percent of the toothpaste market. A tremendous accomplishment in a market dominated by two powerful brands, Crest and Colgate.

### The time of day creneau

> Time of day is also a potential positioning possibility. Nyquil, the first night-time cold remedy, is one example.

### The distribution channel creneau

> Distribution is another possibility. L’eggs was the first hosiery brand to be distributed in supermarkets and mass merchandise outlets. L’eggs now is the leading brand, with sales in the hundreds of millions.

### The Factory Mistake

> One common mistake in looking for creneaus is filling a hole in the factory rather than one in the mind.
>
> Ford’s Edsel is the classic example. In the laughter that followed the demise of poor Edsel, most people missed the point.
> 
> In essence, the Ford people got switched around. The Edsel was a beautiful case of internal positioning to fill a hole between Ford and Mercury on the one hand and Lincoln on the other hand.
> 
> Good strategy inside the factory. Bad strategy outside where there was simply no position for this car in a category already cluttered with heavily chromed, medium-priced cars.
> 
> If the Edsel had been tagged a “high-performance” car and presented in a sleek two-door, bucket-seat form and given a name to match, no one would have laughed. It could have occupied a position that no one else owned, and the ending of the story might have been different.
> 
> Another “fill-the-factory” mistake was the National Observer, the first national weekly newspaper.
> 
> Dow Jones, the Observer’s proud parent, also publishes The Wall Street Journal, but only 5 days a week. Voilà, you can hear somebody say. Let’s fill the factory with a weekly newspaper. That way, we get free use of those expensive Journal presses.
> 
> But where was the hole in the prospect’s mind? He or she could already subscribe to Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report, and other news magazines.
>
> Aah, you say. But the National Observer is a weekly newspaper, not a magazine. But that’s playing semantic games. Prospects didn’t differentiate between the two.

### The Technology Trap

> Even a great technical achievement of a research laboratory will fail if there is no creneau in the mind.
> 
> In 1971 Brown-Forman Distillers launched Frost 8/80, the first “dry, white whisky.”
>
> Frost 8/80 should have been a big success. There was a big hole there. There was no other dry, white whisky. As Brown-Forman president William F. Lucas said, “It was greeted with great applause by our people and a gnashing of teeth by our competitors.”
> 
> Yet less than 2 years later, Frost 8/80 was dead. A multimillion-dollar failure. Volume had totaled just 100,000 cases, one-third of the company’s projections.
> 
> What went wrong? Look at the positioning claim from the prospect’s point of view.
> 
> The first white whisky? Not true. There are at least four others. Their names are gin, vodka, rum, and tequila.
> 
> As a matter of fact, Frost 8/80 ads encouraged the prospect to look at the new whisky as a substitute for other distilled spirits. According to the ads, Frost 8/80 could be used like vodka or gin in martinis, like scotch or bourbon in manhattans and whisky sours.
> 
> Don’t try to trick the prospect. Advertising is not a debate. It’s a seduction.
> 
> The prospect won’t sit still for the finer points of verbal logic. As the politician said, “If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, I say it’s a duck.”

### The Everybody Trap

> Some marketing people reject the “cherchez le creneau” concept. They don’t want to be tied down to a specific position because they believe it limits their sales. Or their opportunities.
> 
> They want to be all things to all people.
> 
> Years ago, when there were a lot fewer brands and a lot less advertising, it made sense to try to appeal to everybody.
> 
> In politics it used to be suicide for a politician to take a strong position on anything. Don’t step on anybody’s toes.
> 
> But today in the product arena and in the political arena, you have to have a position. There are too many competitors out there. You can’t win by not making enemies, by being everything to everybody.
> 
> To win in today’s competitive environment, you have to go out and make friends, carve out a specific niche in the market. Even if you lose a few doing so.
> 
> Today the everybody trap may keep you afloat if you’re already in office or already own a substantial share of market. But it’s deadly if you want to build a position from nowhere.

## Chapter 8. Repositioning the Competition

> There comes a time when you can’t find a creneau. With hundreds of variations in each product category on the market, the chances of finding an open hole today are very slim.
> 
> For example, take your average supermarket, with 12,000 different products or brands on display. That means a young person has to sort out and catalog 12,000 different names in his or her head.
> 
> When you consider that the average college graduate has a speaking vocabulary of only 8000 words, you can see the problem.
> 
> The kid spends 4 years in a university and ends up 4000 words down.
>
> ...
> 
> Because there are so few creneaus to fill, a company must create one by repositioning the competitors that occupy the positions in the mind.
> 
> In other words, to move a new idea or product into the mind, you must first move an old one out.
> 
> “The world is round,” said Christopher Columbus. “No, it’s not,” said the public, “it’s flat.”
> 
> To convince the public otherwise, fifteenth century scientists first had to prove that the world wasn’t flat. One of their more convincing arguments was the fact that sailors at sea were first able to observe the tops of the masts of an approaching ship, then the sails, then the hull. If the world were flat, they would see the whole ship at once.
>
> ...
> 
> Tylenol went out and burst the aspirin bubble.
>
> “For the millions who should not take aspirin,” said Tylenol’s ads. “If your stomach is easily upset … or you have an ulcer … or you suffer from asthma, allergies, or iron-deficiency anemia, it would make good sense to check with your doctor before you take aspirin.
> 
> “Aspirin can irritate the stomach lining,” continued the Tylenol ad, “trigger asthmatic or allergic reactions, cause small amounts of hidden gastrointestinal bleeding.
> 
> “Fortunately, there is Tylenol …”
> 
> Sixty words of copy before any mention of the advertiser’s product.

Reminds me of understanding the stages of the buyer's journey by first identifying the customer's problem.

> Sales of Tylenol acetaminophen took off. Today Tylenol is the No. 1 brand of analgesic. Ahead of Anacin. Ahead of Bayer. Ahead of Bufferin. Ahead of Excedrin. A simple but effective repositioning strategy did the job.
>
> Against an institution like aspirin. Amazing.
>
> ...
>
> “Most American vodkas seem Russian,” said the ads. And the captions said: “Samovar: Made in Schenley, Pennsylvania. Smirnoff: Made in Hartford, Connecticut. Wolfschmidt: Made in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.
> 
> “Stolichnaya is different. It is Russian,” continued the ad. And the bottle is labeled, “Made in Leningrad, Russia.”
> 
> Stolichnaya sales began to soar as a result. Needless to say.
> 
> But why the need to disparage the competition? Couldn’t PepsiCo, the importers of the Stolichnaya brand, have simply advertised it as the “Russian vodka?”
> 
> They could have, of course. But that presumes a degree of product interest on the part of the vodka buyer that just doesn’t exist.
> 
> How many times have you picked up a bottle of liquor and read the label to find out where it was made? Furthermore, the names themselves (Samovar, Smirnoff, Wolfschmidt, Popov, Nikolai) imply a Russian origin. It’s this latter factor alone that was responsible for much of Stolichnaya’s astounding success.
> 
> People like to see the high and mighty exposed. Note how other vodka ads play into Stolichnaya’s hands.
>
> ...
>
> The success of the Tylenol, Scope, Royal Doulton, and other repositioning programs has spawned a host of similar advertising. Too often, however, these copycat campaigns have missed the essence of repositioning strategy.
> 
> “We’re better than our competitors” isn’t repositioning. It’s comparative advertising and not very effective. There’s a psychological flaw in the advertiser’s reasoning which the prospect is quick to detect. “If your brand is so good, how come it’s not the leader?”
> 
> A look at comparative ads suggests why most of them aren’t effective. They fail to reposition the competition.
> 
> Rather, they use the competitor as a benchmark for their own brand. Then they tell the reader or viewer how much better they are. Which, of course, is exactly what the prospect expects the advertiser to say.
> 
> “Ban is more effective than Right Guard, Secret, Sure, Arrid Extra Dry, Mitchum, Soft & Dry, Body All, and Dial,” said a recent Ban ad. The reader looks at an ad like this and asks, “What else is new?”
>
> ...
> 
> In the past advertising was prepared in isolation. That is, you studied the product and its features, and then you prepared advertising which communicated to your customers and prospects the benefits of those features. It didn’t make much difference whether the competition offered those features or not.
> 
> In the traditional approach, you ignored competition and made every claim seem like a preemptive claim. Mentioning a competitive product, for example, was considered not only bad taste but poor strategy as well.
> 
> In the positioning era, however, the rules are reversed. To establish a position, you must often not only name competitive names but also ignore most of the old advertising rules as well.
> 
> In category after category, the prospect already knows the benefits of using the product. To climb on his or her product ladder, you must relate your brand to the brands already in the prospect’s mind.
> 
> Yet repositioning programs, even though effective, have stirred up a host of complaints. Many advertising people deplore the use of such tactics.
>
> ...
> 
> Culture and refinement may be admirable qualities, but not in advertising.
>
> Is society sick when people are ready to believe the worst about a product or person, but balk about believing the best?
> 
> Are newspapers wrong to put the bad news on the front page and the good news in the back along with the society columns? (If they print any at all.)
> 
> The communication industry is like gossip. It feeds on the bad news, not the good.
> 
> It may not be your idea of the way things should be. It just happens to be the way things are.
> 
> To be successful in this overcommunicated society of ours, you have to play the game by the rules that society sets. Not your own.
> 
> Don’t be discouraged. A little disparagement may be preferable in the long run to a lot of conventional “brag and boast.”
> 
> Done honestly and fairly, it keeps the competition on their toes.

## Chapter 9. The Power of the Name

> The name is the hook that hangs the brand on the product ladder in the prospect’s mind. In the positioning era, the single most important marketing decision you can make is what to name the product.
>
> Shakespeare was wrong. A rose by any other name would not smell as sweet. Not only do you see what you want to see, you also smell what you want to smell. Which is why the single most important decision in the marketing of perfume is the name you decide to put on the brand.
> 
> Would “Alfred” have sold as well as “Charlie?” Don’t bet on it.
> 
> And Hog Island in the Caribbean was going nowhere until they changed the name to Paradise Island.
>
> ...
>
> Like Head & Shoulders shampoo, Intensive Care skin lotion, and Close-Up toothpaste.
>
> Or like DieHard for a longer-lasting battery. Shake ’n Bake for a new way to cook chicken. Edge for a shaving cream that lets you shave closer.
> 
> A name should not go “over the edge,” though. That is, become so close to the product itself that it becomes generic, a general name for all products of its class rather than a trade name for a specific brand.
>
> ...
> 
> Many people think Time is a great name for a magazine. And in a way, it is. Short, catchy, memorable. But it’s also subtle and tricky. (Time could be a trade magazine for the watch industry.)
>
> _Fortune is another name cut out of the same cloth. (Fortune could be a magazine for stockbrokers, commodity traders, or gamblers. It’s not clear.) Business Week is a much better name. Also a more successful magazine._
>
> ...
> 
> Engineers and scientists in love with their own creations are responsible for some of the really bad names. Names like XD-12, for example. (Presumably standing for “experimental design number 12.”) These are inside jokes that have no meaning in the mind of the prospect.
>
> ...
> 
> The first company into the mind with a new product or new idea is going to become famous. Whether the name is Lindbergh or Smith or Rumplestiltskin.
>
> Coca-Cola was first with a cola drink. Kodak was first with low-cost photography. Xerox was first with the plain-paper copier.
>
> ...
> 
> With names like “high-fructose corn syrup,” it’s no wonder that even in the trade the products were considered imitation or second-class in comparison with sucrose or “real sugar.” So Corn Products, one of the major suppliers of corn syrups, decided to call its sweeteners “corn sugars.” This move allowed the company to put corn on an equal footing with cane and beet.
> 
> “Consider all three types of sugar,” say the ads. “Cane, beet, and corn.”
> 
> Marketing people should know that the Federal Trade Commission is the keeper of the generics for many industries. But the FTC can be persuaded. “If we can’t call it sugar, can we put corn syrup in a soft drink and call the product ‘sugar-free’?”
> 
> Special-interest groups recognize the power of a good name. The “Right to Life” movement and “fair trade” laws are two examples.
> 
> And what senator or representative would dare oppose a bill called the “Clean Air Act?”
>
> ...
> 
> What does a company do when its name (Goodrich) is similar to the name of a larger company in the same field (Goodyear)?
> 
> ...
>
> B. F. Goodrich was the first domestic company to market steel-belted radial-ply tires in the United States. Yet several years later when tire buyers were asked which company makes steel-belted radials, 56 percent named Goodyear, which didn’t make them for the domestic market. Only 47 percent said Goodrich, which did.

## Chapter 10. The No-Name Trap

> “I’m going to L.A.,” the corporate executive will say. “And then I have to make a trip to New York.” Why is Los Angeles often called L.A., but New York is seldom called N.Y.?
>
> “I worked for GE for a couple of years and then went to Western Union.” Why is General Electric often called GE, but Western Union is seldom called WU?
>
> General Motors is often GM, American Motors is often AM, but Ford Motor is almost never FM.
>
> The principle at work here is phonetic shorthand.
>
> Ra-di-o Cor-po-ra-tion of A-mer-i-ca is 12 syllables long. No wonder most people use R-C-A, three syllables long.
>
> Gen-er-al E-lec-tric is six syllables long, so most people use G-E, two syllables.
>
> Gen-er-al Mo-tors is often GM. A-mer-i-can Mo-tors is often AM. But Ford Mo-tor is almost never referred to as FM. The single syllable Ford says it all.
>
> But where there’s no phonetic advantage, most people won’t use initials. New York and N.Y. are both two syllables long. So while the initials N.Y. are often written, they are seldom spoken.
> 
> Los An-ge-les is four syllables long, so L.A. is frequently used. Note, too, that San Fran-cis-co, a four-syllable word, is seldom shortened to “S.F.” Why? There’s a perfectly good two syllable word (Frisco) to use a shorthand for San Francisco. Which is why people say “Jer-sey” for New Jersey instead of “N.J.”
> 
> When they have a choice of a word or a set of initials, both equal in phonetic length, people will invariably use the word, not the initials.
> 
> Phonetic length can sometimes fool you. The initials WU look a lot shorter than the name Western Union. But phonetically they are exactly the same length. Dou-ble-U U. West-ern Un-ion. (Except for W, every other English language letter is just one syllable.)
> 
> While customers refer to companies phonetically, the companies they talk about have a different way of looking at themselves. Companies are visually oriented. They go to a lot of trouble making sure the names look right without considering how it sounds.
>
> ...
> 
> A company must be extremely well known before it can use initials successfully. Apparently the use of the initials “GE” triggers the words “General Electric” inside the brain.
>
> Invariably, people must know the name first before they will respond to initials. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service are extremely well known. So we respond instantly to FBI and IRS.
>
> ...
> 
> When you were a child, you first learned to speak and then to read. And you learned to read slowly and laboriously by saying the words out loud as you forced your mind to connect the written word with the aural sound stored in the brain.
>
> By comparison, learning to speak requires much less effort than learning to read. We store sounds directly and then play them back in various combinations as our mental dexterity improves.
>
> As you grow up, you learn to translate written words into the aural language needed by the brain so rapidly that you are unaware the translation process is taking place.
>
> ...
> 
> Another reason companies drop their names for initials is the obsolescence of the name itself. RCA sells a lot of things besides radios.
>
> And how about United Shoe Machinery? The company had become a conglomerate. Furthermore, the domestic shoe machinery market was drying up as imports continually increased their share. What to do? They took the easy way out. United Shoe Machinery changed its name to USM Corporation. And lived anonymously ever after.
>
> ...
> 
> In spite of the drawbacks, companies are lured to initials like moths to a candle. The success of the IBMs of this world seems to be proof that initials are effective. It’s the classic confusion between cause and effect.
>
> International Business Machines became so rich and famous (the cause) that everyone knew what company you were talking about when you used its initials (the effect).
>
> When you try to reverse the procedure, it doesn’t work. You can’t use the initials of a company that is only modestly successful (the cause) and then expect it to become rich and famous (the effect).

## Chapter 11. The Free-Ride Trap

> Take a product called Alka-Seltzer Plus. Let’s see if we can visualize how Alka-Seltzer Plus might have gotten its name.
>
> A bunch of the boys are sitting around a conference table trying to name a new cold remedy designed to compete with Dristan and Contac.
>
> “I have it,” says Harry. “Let’s call it Alka-Seltzer Plus. That way we can take advantage of the $20 million a year we’re already spending on the Alka-Seltzer name.”
>
> “Good thinking, Harry,” and another money-saving idea is instantly accepted, as most money-saving ideas usually are.
> 
> But lo and behold, instead of eating into the Dristan and Contac market, the new product turns around and eats into the Alka-Seltzer market.
> 
> Every so often the makers of Alka-Seltzer Plus redesign the label. The “Alka-Seltzer” gets smaller and smaller, and the “Plus” gets bigger and bigger.
> 
> A better name for the product would have been Bromo-Seltzer Plus. That way they could have taken business away from the competition.
>
> In the product era life was simpler. Each company specialized in a single line. The name told it all.
> 
> Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, U.S. Rubber, United Airlines, Pennsylvania Railroad.
> 
> But technological progress created opportunities. So companies started branching into new fields.
>
> Enter the conglomerate. The company that specializes in nothing. By development or acquisition, the conglomerate is prepared to enter any field in which it thinks it can make a buck.
>
> Take General Electric. GE makes everything from jet engines to nuclear power plants to plastics.
> 
> RCA is in satellite communications, solid-state electronics, and rent-a-cars.
> 
> Many people pooh-pooh the conglomerate. Companies should “stick to their knitting,” they say. But conglomerates have provided the capital to sustain vigorous competition in the marketplace. If it weren’t for the conglomerates, we would be a nation of semimonopolies.
>
> Take copiers, for example. Xerox, the pioneer in the plain-paper field, now faces competition from the computer manufacturer (IBM), from a photo company (Kodak), and from a postage-meter company (Pitney Bowes).
> 
> Even when conglomerates grow by acquisition (RCA’s purchase of Hertz, ITT’s purchase of Avis), they provide the money needed to sustain growth and competition.
> 
> Otherwise, when the original founders retired or died, the tax bite would leave the company too weak to defend its turf.
> 
> The typical life cycle of a corporation starts with an entrepreneur with an idea. If successful, you can count on two things, death and taxes, to ensure that the operation will end up as part of a conglomerate.
>
> ...
> 
> When the company develops a product by external acquisition, it usually keeps the existing name. RCA kept the Hertz name. ITT kept the Avis name.
>
> But not always.
> 
> When Sperry-Rand developed a computer line internally, they called the product Univac. When Xerox went into computers by external acquisition, they changed the name from Scientific Data Systems to Xerox Data Systems.
> 
> Corporate egos aside, when should a company use the house name and when should they select a new name? (You can’t really disregard corporate egos. Try telling General Electric not to put the GE name on a new product and you’ll begin to appreciate the enormity of the corporate ego problem.)
>
> One reason why the principles of name selection remain so elusive is the Charles Lindbergh syndrome.
> 
> If you get into the mind first, any name is going to work.
> 
> If you didn’t get there first, then you are flirting with disaster if you don’t select an appropriate name.
>
> To illustrate the advantages of separate names rather than house names, compare the strategies of Procter & Gamble with those of Colgate-Palmolive.
>
> You’ll find many house names in the Colgate-Palmolive line. To name a few: Colgate toothpaste, Colgate toothbrushes, Palmolive Rapid Shave, Palmolive dishwashing liquid, Palmolive soap.
> 
> You won’t find any house names in the Procter & Gamble lineup. Procter & Gamble carefully positions each product so that it occupies a unique niche in the mind. For example: Tide makes clothes “white.” Cheer makes them “whiter than white.” And Bold makes them “bright.”
>
> With fewer brands Procter & Gamble does twice as much business and makes five times as much profit as Colgate-Palmolive.
>
> While it’s fashionable on Madison Avenue these days to pooh-pooh Procter & Gamble advertising, it’s interesting to note that Procter & Gamble makes more money every year than all of America’s 6000 advertising agencies combined.
>
> ...
> 
> When you look into the prospect’s mind, you can see what went wrong.
>
> It’s the teeter-totter principle. One name can’t stand for two distinctly different products. When one goes up, the other goes down.
>
> ...
>
> One reason why companies keep looking for a free ride is that they underestimate the value of anonymity.
>
> In politics, in marketing, in life, anonymity is a resource, easily squandered by too much publicity.
> 
> “You can’t beat somebody with a nobody,” goes the old political saying. But today you can.
> 
> The rapid rise of a “nobody” like Gary Hart is proof that politics is a different game today. The old maxims are no longer valid.
> 
> Richard Nixon may be the best-known political name in the world. But almost any nobody could beat him.
> 
> Publicity is like eating. Nothing kills the appetite quite as much as a hearty meal. And nothing kills the publicity potential of a product or a person quite as much as a cover story in a national magazine.
> 
> The media are constantly looking for the new and different, the fresh young face.
> 
> In dealing with media, you must conserve your anonymity until you are ready to spend it. And then when you spend it, spend it big. Always keeping in mind that the objective is not publicity or communication for its own sake, but publicity to achieve a position in the prospect’s mind.

## Chapter 12. The Line-Extension Trap

> When the marketing history of the past decade is written, the single most significant trend will have to be line extension. That is, taking the name of an established product and using it on a new one. (The free-ride trap carried to its ultimate conclusion.)
>
> Dial soap, Dial deodorant.
>
> Life Savers candy. Life Savers gum.
>
> Kleenex tissue. Kleenex towels.
>
> Line extension has swept through the advertising and marketing community like Sherman through Georgia. And for some very sound reasons.
>
> Logic is on the side of line extension. Arguments of economics. Trade acceptance. Consumer acceptance. Lower advertising costs. Increased income. The corporate image.
>
> Logic is on the side of line extension. Truth, unfortunately, is not.
>
> Line extension is a result of clear, hard-headed, inside-out thinking that goes something like this:
> 
> “We make Dial soap, a great product that gets the biggest share of the bar-soap market. When our customers see Dial deodorant, they’ll know it comes from the makers of the great Dial soap.”
> 
> “Furthermore,” and this is the clincher, “Dial is a deodorant soap. Our customers will expect us to produce a high-quality underarm deodorant.” In short, Dial soap customers will buy Dial deodorants.
>
> ...
> 
> Dial has a large share of the soap market and a very small share of the deodorant market.
>
> ...
>
> Let’s look at line extension from the point of view of the prospect and work backward.
>
> Both Dial and Bayer hold strong positions inside the prospect’s mind.
>
> But what does it mean to own a position in the mind? Simply this: The brand name becomes a surrogate or substitute for the generic name.
> 
> “Where is the Bayer?”
>
> “Hand me the Dial.”
>
> The stronger the position, the more often this substitution takes place. Some brands are so strong they are practically generic. Fiberglas, Formica, Jell-O, Kleenex, Band-Aid, Sanka. “Generic” brand names are, of course, close to the edge, so they have to be handled carefully or Uncle Sam will take your goodies away.
>
> From a communication point of view, the generic brand name is very efficient. One word serves in place of two. When you have a generic brand name, you can afford to ignore the brand and promote the category.
> 
> “Coffee keeps you awake? Drink Sanka.”
>
> “Serve your family low-calorie Jell-O instead of cake or pie.”
> 
> From the prospect’s point of view, line extension works against the generic brand position. It blurs the sharp focus of the brand in the mind. No longer can the prospect say “Bayer” if he or she wants aspirin. Or “Dial” for soap.
>
> In a sense, line extension educates the prospect to the fact that Bayer is nothing but a brand name. It destroys the illusion that Bayer is a superior form of aspirin. Or that Dial is deodorant soap rather than just a brand name for a deodorant soap.
>
> ...
>
> The consumer and the manufacturer see things in totally different ways.
>
> Would you believe that to the folks down in Atlanta, Coca-Cola is not a soft drink? To the manufacturer, Coca-Cola is a company, a brand name, an institution, and a great place to work.
> 
> But to the consumer, Coca-Cola is a sweet, dark, carbonated beverage. What’s in the glass is Coke. It’s not a cola drink manufactured by a company called Coca-Cola.
> 
> The tablets in a bottle of aspirin are Bayer. Not aspirin manufactured by a company called Bayer. (The company name, of course, is Sterling Drug, not Bayer. So Bayer nonaspirin could just as logically have been called Sterling nonaspirin.)
> 
> The great strength of a generic brand name is this close identification with the product itself. In the consumer’s mind, Bayer is aspirin and every other aspirin brand becomes “imitation Bayer.”
> 
> The Coca-Cola slogan, “The real thing,” capitalizes on the tendency of the prospect to put the first product into the mind on a pedestal and to treat the me-too products as somehow inferior to the original.
>
> ...
> 
> Perhaps the classic example of the line-extension trap is what happened to Protein 21 shampoo.
> 
> A number of years ago the Mennen company introduced a combination shampoo/conditioner called Protein 21, which rapidly carved out a 13 percent share of the shampoo market.
> 
> Then Mennen hit the line-extension lure. In rapid succession, the company introduced Protein 21 hairspray in regular and extra hold, scented and unscented. Also Protein 21 conditioner (in two formulas) and Protein 21 concentrate. And to make sure you can’t remember what to put on your hair, Mennen also markets Protein 29. For men.
> 
> No wonder Protein 21’s share of the shampoo market has fallen from 13 percent to 2 percent. And the decline is bound to continue.
> 
> But as incredible as it may seem, line extensions continue to sweep the packaged goods field.

## Chapter 13. When Line Extension Can Work

> One of the reasons for the continuing popularity of line extension is that in the short term, line extension has some advantages.
>
> Let’s say there was going to be a professional swimming team in New York. “Here come the Wets” might be a typical newspaper headline announcing the event. With one word, “Wets,” we know it’s (1) a professional sports team, (2) located in the metropolitan New York area, and (3) involved in some kind of water sport.
>
> But that’s only in the short term. As the original announcement fades in the mind, confusion sets in.
>
> ...
>
> Because the line-extension name is related to the original name, it achieves an instant flash of understanding. “Ah, yes, Diet Coca-Cola.”
>
> It also generates an instant flash of sales. When Alka-Seltzer announces a new product like Alka-Seltzer Plus, everybody stocks up on it. Consumers aren’t necessarily buying it, but retailers are.
> 
> So the early sales figures look good. (To book $1 million worth of business, you only have to sell $35 worth to every supermarket.)
> 
> Business looks great the first 6 months as you fill the pipelines. But when the reorders don’t come in, all of a sudden things turn dark.
>
> After the initial recognition of a line-extension brand, the prospect is never quite sure there is such a product.
> 
> Schlitz Light, Pall Mall Extra Mild, Jergens Extra Dry. Brand names like these slide into (and out of) the mind effortlessly. They require almost no mental work on the part of the prospect.
>
> Easy come, easy go. Line-extension names are forgettable because they have no independent position in the mind. They are satellites to the original brand name. Their only contribution is to blur the position occupied by the original name. Often with catastrophic results.

## Chapter 14. Positioning a Company: Xerox

> When a new employee accepts a job, he or she “buys” the company. (With its recruiting programs, a company is actually selling itself.)
> 
> Who would you rather work for, General Electric or the Schenectady Electrical Works?
> 
> Every year companies across the country compete for top graduates at the nation’s leading universities. Who do you think gets the cream of the crop?
> 
> That’s right. The companies that occupy the best positions in the minds of the prospective employee. The General Electrics, the Procter & Gambles.
> 
> _And when investors buy a share of stock, what they are really paying for is a piece of that company’s position, now and in the future._
> 
> How much a person is willing to pay for that stock (six or sixty times earnings) depends on the strength of that position in the buyer’s mind.
> 
> Positioning a company effectively has lots of advantages if you happen to be an officer or director of that corporation. It’s not easy, though.
>
> ...
> 
> Most people think that the bigger, more successful companies have the better people. And the smaller, less successful companies have the leftovers.
>
> So if your company occupies the top rung of the product ladder in the prospect’s mind, you can be sure that the prospect will also think that your company has the best people.
> 
> If you’re not on top and you tell the prospect you have the better people.… Well, that’s one of those inconsistencies that doesn’t usually get resolved in your favor.
>
> ...
> 
> Even the stock market consistently undervalues conglomerates like ITT and Gulf & Western. (Many companies are worth more broken into parts than they are worth whole.)
>
> ...
> 
> Why would Xerox want a position? Xerox has a position. Xerox is the Coca-Cola of copiers.
>
> Xerox sees the office market moving toward systems, expecially computer-based information systems. So Xerox bought Scientific Data Systems and subsequently changed the name to Xerox Data Systems.
>
> “Our objective in acquiring SDS,” said the chairman, “was to offer broader-based information systems. We feel that to really seize the opportunities around the world for supplying information, we had to broaden out from graphics, as IBM is broadening out into graphics. People in the seventies who can say to a customer, ‘We can handle all your information needs, whether fascimile transmission, graphics, or whatever,’ will have an enormous advantage.”
>
> Six years later, Xerox Data Systems folded. But the loss of XDS didn’t stop Xerox from trying to broaden the company’s product line. Xerox was still committed to the concept of going beyond copiers.
> 
> In the years to come, Xerox introduced a parade of office automation products. The XTEN network, the Ethernet network, the Star workstation, the 820 personal computer. “Now the industry will know our secret for certain,” declared a Xerox vice president. “We want to be No. 1 in this market.”
>
> ...
> 
> What can Xerox do? Our message to Xerox is to stop fighting copiers. You can’t change what’s in the prospect’s mind.
>
> ...
> 
> Xerox is a $9 billion company with more than 100,000 employees. It ought to be impossible to position an enterprise as big and diverse as Xerox with a single word.
> 
> But in an overcommunicated society there is only so much room in the mind. Today Xerox means just one word—copiers. Tomorrow Xerox could use lasography to create a broader mental position.

## Chapter 15. Positioning a Country: Belgium

>

## Chapter 16. Positioning an Island: Jamaica

> When Edward Seaga replaced socialist Michael Manley as Jamaican prime minister, he proclaimed an open door for capitalist investment.
>
> David Rockefeller was so impressed, he formed a group of 25 American corporate chiefs specifically for the purpose of developing Jamaica. In the due course of events the Jamaicans, encouraged by the Rockefeller committee, hired us to develop a position for the island of Jamaica.
>
> ...
>
> At 7402 feet, Blue Mountain in Jamaica is higher than any point in the United States east of the Mississippi River.
>
> ...
> 
> Conceptually, this approach says to tourists that the things they travel a great distance to Hawaii for (natural beauty, big green mountains, beautiful beaches, wonderful year-round weather) can be found a lot closer to home, down in the Caribbean.
> 
> Jamaica could even copy one of the most successful of Hawaii’s marketing ploys: meeting tourists with flowers at the airport.
> 
> Jamaica has beautiful flowers and this gesture, above all, would say that Jamaica is a friendly place as well as a beautiful one.
> 
> “The Hawaii of the Caribbean” provides a quick visual analogy. Jamaica doesn’t have the luxury of building that visual image over the years. Transferring Hawaii’s mental picture postcards will save enormous amounts of time and money.
>
> Furthermore, the concept strongly differentiates Jamaica from the other Caribbean destinations.
>
> ...
> 
> If you’re wondering why you haven’t heard much about the Hawaii of the Caribbean, you’ll have to ask Mr. Seaga. He is widely viewed as a Caribbean Ronald Reagan, but “he is really the Jimmy Carter of Jamaica,” a Rockefeller aide told The Wall Street Journal. “He’s the person who gets involved in every detail and agonizes over every issue.”
> 
> Presumably he is still agonizing over this one.

## Chapter 23. Positioning Yourself and Your Career

> What are you? People suffer from the same disease as products. They try to be all things to all people.
> 
> The problem with this approach is the mind of the prospect. It’s difficult enough to link one concept with each product. It’s almost impossible with two or three or more concepts.
> 
> The most difficult part of positioning is selecting that one specific concept to hang your hat on. Yet you must, if you want to cut through the prospect’s wall of indifference.
> 
> What are you? What is your own position in life? Can you sum up your own position in a single concept? Then can you run your own career to establish and exploit that position?
> 
> Most people aren’t ruthless enough to set up a single concept for themselves. They vacillate. They expect others to do it for them.
>
> “I’m the best lawyer in Dallas.”
>
> Are you? How often would your name be mentioned if we took a survey of the Dallas legal community?
>
> “I’m the best lawyer in Dallas” is a position that can be achieved with some talent, some luck, and a lot of strategy. And the first step is to isolate the concept that you are going to use to establish that long-term position. It’s not easy. But the rewards can be great.
>
> ...
> 
> Therefore, anything worthwhile doing is worthwhile doing lousy.
>
> Your reputation will probably be better within the company if you try many times and succeed sometimes than if you fear failure and only try for sure things.
>
> ...
> 
> Remember Leonard Slye? Few people did, until he changed his name to Roy Rogers, an important first step in becoming a motion picture star.
>
> How about Marion Morrison? A little feminine for a he-man cowboy, so he changed it to John Wayne.

> Common law grants you the right to adopt any name you want as long as you’re not trying to defraud or be deceptive. So don’t change your name to McDonald and open up a hamburger stand.
>
> ...
> 
> As young executives, they notice that top managers usually use initials: J. S. Smith, R. H. Jones. So they do the same. On memos and in letters.
>
> It’s a mistake. You can afford to do that only if everyone knows who you are. If you’re on your way up, if you’re trying to burn your name into the minds of top management, you need a name, not a set of initials. For exactly the same reasons your company does.
>
> Write your name and look at it. Roger P. Dinkelacker.
>
> What a name like this says psychologically to management is: We are such a big company and you have such an insignificant job that you must use the “P” to differentiate yourself from the other Roger Dinkelackers on the staff.
>
> ...
> 
> Frank Sinatra, Jr., is an example of the most difficult kind of line-extension name. He literally started with two strikes against him.
>
> With a name like Frank Sinatra, Jr., the audience says to itself, “He’s not going to be able to sing as well as his father.”
>
> Since you hear what you expect to hear, of course he doesn’t.
>
> ...
> 
> Some ambitious, intelligent people find themselves trapped in situations where their future looks bleak. So what do they generally do?
>
> They try harder. They try to compensate by long hours of hard work and effort. The secret of success is to keep your nose to the grindstone, do your job better than the next person, and fame and fortune will come your way, right?
>
> Wrong. Trying harder is rarely the pathway to success. Trying smarter is the better way.
>
> It’s the story of the shoemaker’s children all over again. Too often, management people don’t know how to manage their own careers.
> 
> Their own promotional strategy is often based on the naive assumption that ability and hard work are all that counts. And so they dig in and work harder, waiting for the day that someone will tap them on the shoulder with the magic wand.
> 
> But that day seldom comes.
> 
> The truth is, the road to fame and fortune is rarely found within yourself. The only sure way to success is to find yourself a horse to ride. It may be difficult for the ego to accept, but success in life is based more on what others can do for you than on what you can do for yourself.
> 
> Kennedy was wrong. Ask not what you can do for your company. Ask what your company can do for you. Therefore, if you want to take maximum advantage of the opportunities that your career has to offer, you must keep your eyes open and find yourself a horse to do the job for you.
>
> **The first horse to ride is your company.** Where is your company going? Or more impolitely, is it going anywhere at all?
>
> Too many good people have taken their good prospects and locked them into situations that are doomed to failure. But failure at least gives you a second chance. Even worse is the company with less than average chances for growth.
> 
> No matter how brilliant you are, it never pays to cast your lot with a loser. Even the best officer on the Titanic wound up in the same lifeboat as the worst. And that’s if he was lucky enough to stay out of the water.
> 
> You can’t do it yourself. If your company is going nowhere, get yourself a new one. While you can’t always pick an IBM or a Xerox, you ought to be able to do considerably better than average.
> 
> Place your bets on the growth industries. Tomorrow-type products like computers, electronics, optics, communications.
> 
> And don’t forget that soft services of all types are growing at a much faster rate than hard products. So look at banks, leasing, insurance, medical, financial, and consulting service companies.
> 
> Don’t forget that your experience with yesterday-type products can blind you to opportunities in totally different product areas. And especially services.
> 
> And when you change jobs to join one of those tomorrow-type companies, don’t just ask how much they are going to pay you today.
> 
> Also ask how much they are likely to pay you tomorrow.
>
> **The second horse to ride is your boss.** Ask yourself the same questions about your boss as you asked yourself about your company.
>
> Is he or she going anywhere? If not, who is? Always try to work for the smartest, brightest, most competent person you can find.
>
> If you look at biographies of successful people, it’s amazing to find how many crawled up the ladder of success right behind someone else. From their first assignment in some menial job to their last as president or CEO of a major company.
> 
> Yet some people actually like to work for incompetents. I suppose they feel that a fresh flower stands out better if it’s surrounded by wilted ones. They forget the tendency of top management to throw the whole bunch out if they become dissatisfied with an operation.
> 
> Two types of individuals come in looking for jobs.
>
> One is inordinately proud of his or her specialty. He or she will often say, “You people really need me around here. You’re weak in my specialty.”
> 
> The other type says just the opposite. “You’re strong in my specialty. You do a terrific job, and I want to work with the best.”
>
> Which type is more likely to get the job? Right. The latter person.
> 
> On the other hand, strange as it might seem, top management people see more of the other type. The person who wants to be an expert. Preferably with a big title and salary to match.
> 
> “Hitch your wagon to a star,” said Ralph Waldo Emerson. Good advice then. Even better advice now.
> 
> If your boss is going places, chances are good that you are too.
>
> **The third horse to ride is a friend.** Many business people have an enormous number of personal friends but no business friends. And while personal friends are awfully nice to have and can sometimes get you a deal on a TV set or braces for the kids, they’re usually not too helpful when it comes to finding a better job.
>
> Most of the big breaks that happen in a person’s career happen because a business friend recommended that person.
>
> ...
> 
> When you need a job, it’s usually too late to try that type of tactic. The way to ride the friendship horse is to keep in touch regularly with all your business friends.
>
> Send them tear sheets of articles they may be interested in, clips of publicity items, and congratulatory letters when they get promoted.
> 
> And don’t assume people always see stories that might have mentioned them. They don’t. And they always appreciate it when someone sends them an item they may have missed.
>
> **The fourth horse to ride is an idea.** On the night before he died, Victor Hugo wrote in his diary, “Nothing, not all the armies of the world, can stop an idea whose time has come.”
>
> Everyone knows that an idea can take you to the top faster than anything else. But people sometimes expect too much of an idea. They want one that is not only great, but one that everyone else thinks is great too.
> 
> There are no such ideas. If you wait until an idea is ready to be accepted, it’s too late. Someone else will have preempted it.
> 
> Or in the in-out vocabulary of a few years ago: Anything definitely in is already on its way out.
> 
> ...
> 
> “One indication of the validity of a principle,” according to psychologist Charles Osgood, “is the vigor and persistence with which it is opposed.” “In any field,” says Dr. Osgood, “if people see that a principle is obvious nonsense and easy to refute, they tend to ignore it. On the other hand, if the principle is difficult to refute and it causes them to question some of their own basic assumptions with which their names may be identified, they have to go out of their way to find something wrong with it.”
>
> Never be afraid of conflict.
> 
> ...
> 
> An idea or concept without an element of conflict is not an idea at all. It’s motherhood, apple pie, and the flag, revisited.
>
> **The fifth horse to ride is faith.** Faith in others and their ideas. The importance of getting outside of yourself, of finding your fortune on the outside, is illustrated by the story of a man who was a failure most of his life.
> 
> His name was Ray Kroc, and he was a lot older than most people and a failure to boot when he met two brothers who changed his life.
> 
> For the brothers had an idea, but no faith. So they sold their idea as well as their name to Ray Kroc for relatively few dollars.
> 
> ...
> 
> **The sixth horse to ride is yourself.** There is one other horse. An animal that is mean, difficult, and unpredictable. Yet people often try to ride it. With very little success.
>
> That horse is yourself. It is possible to succeed in business or in life all by yourself. But it’s not easy.
> 
> Like life itself, business is a social activity. As much cooperation as competition.
> 
> Take selling, for example, You don’t make a sale all by yourself. Somebody also has to buy what you’re selling.
> 
> So remember, the winningest jockeys are not necessarily the lightest, the smartest, or the strongest. The best jockey doesn’t win the race.
> 
> The jockey that wins the race is usually the one with the best horse.
> 
> So pick yourself a horse to ride and then ride it for all it’s worth.

## Chapter 24. Positioning Your Business

> **1. What position do you own?**
>
> Positioning is thinking in reverse. Instead of starting with yourself, you start with the mind of the prospect.
>
> Instead of asking what you are, you ask what position you already own in the mind of the prospect.
> 
> Changing minds in our overcommunicated society is an extremely difficult task. It’s much easier to work with what’s already there.
> 
> In determining the state of the prospect’s mind, it’s important not to let corporate egos get in the way. You get the answer to the question “What position do we own?” from the marketplace, not from the marketing manager.
> 
> If this requires a few dollars for research, so be it. Spend the money. It’s better to know exactly what you’re up against now than to discover it later when nothing can be done about it.
>
> Don’t be narrow-minded. You must look at the big picture, not the details.
>
> Sabena’s problem is not Sabena, the airline, but Belgium, the country.
> 
> Seven-Up’s problem is not the prospect’s attitude toward lemon/lime drinks, but the overwhelming share of mind occupied by the colas. “Get me a soda,” to many people, means a Coke or a Pepsi.
> 
> Looking at the big picture helped Seven-Up develop its successful uncola program.
> 
> Most products today are like 7-Up before the uncola campaign. They have weak or nonexistent positions in the minds of most prospects.
> 
> What you must do is to find a way into the mind by hooking your product, service, or concept to what’s already there.
>
> **2. What position do you want to own?**
> 
> Here is where you bring out your crystal ball and try to figure out the best position to own from a long-term point of view. “Own” is the key word. Too many programs set out to communicate a position that is impossible to preempt because someone else already owns it.
> 
> Ford failed to position the Edsel successfully. One reason was there simply was no room in the mind of the auto buyer for another heavily chromed, medium-priced car.
> 
> ...
> 
> Sometimes you can want too much. You can want to own a position that’s too broad. A position that can’t be established in the prospect’s mind. And even if it could, it couldn’t be defended against the assaults of narrowly based products like Nyquil.
>
> This, of course, is the everybody trap, and one example is a famous campaign for a beer called Rheingold. This brewery wanted to preempt New York City’s working class. (Not a bad objective when you consider the large number of heavy beer drinkers in this group.)
> 
> So they produced some marvelous commercials featuring Italians drinking Rheingold, Blacks drinking Rheingold, Irish drinking Rheingold, Jews drinking Rheingold, and so on.
> 
> Well, rather than appeal to everybody, they ended up appealing to nobody. The reason was simple. Prejudice being a basic human commodity, the fact that one ethnic group drank Rheingold sure didn’t impress another ethnic group.
> 
> In fact, all the campaign did was alienate every ethnic group in New York.
>
> ...
> 
> **3. Whom must you outgun?**
> 
> If your proposed position calls for a head-to-head approach against a marketing leader, forget it. It’s better to go around an obstacle rather than over it. Back up. Try to select a position that no one else has a firm grip on.
> 
> You must spend as much time thinking about the situation from the point of view of your competitors as you do thinking about it from your own.
> 
> Prospects don’t buy, they choose. Among brands of automobiles. Among brands of beer. Among brands of computers. The merit, or lack of merit, of your brand is not nearly as important as your position among the possible choices.
> 
> ...
> 
> **4. Do you have enough money?**
> 
> A big obstacle to successful positioning is attempting to achieve the impossible. It takes money to build a share of mind. It takes money to establish a position. It takes money to hold a position once you’ve established it.

I'm sure there are ways to get publicity without money. Advertising will cost but you advertise to hold your position in the market not to get to that position.

> If you don’t spend enough to get above the noise level, you allow the Procter & Gambles of this world to take your concept away from you. One way to cope with the noise-level problem is to reduce the geographic scope of your problem. To introduce new products or new ideas on a market-by-market basis rather than nationally or even internationally.
> 
> With a given number of dollars, it’s better to overspend in one city than to underspend in several cities. If you become successful in one location, you can always roll out the program to other places. Provided the first location is appropriate.
> 
> If you can become the No. 1 scotch in New York (the No. 1 scotch-drinking area of the country), you can roll out the product to the rest of the U.S.A.
>
> **5. Can you stick it out?**
> 
> You can think of our overcommunicated society as a constant crucible of change. As one idea replaces another in bewildering succession.
>
> To cope with change, it’s important to take a long-range point of view. To determine your basic position and then stick to it.
> 
> Positioning is a concept that is cumulative. Something that takes advantage of advertising’s long-range nature.
> 
> You have to hang in there, year after year. Most successful companies rarely change a winning formula. How many years have you seen those Marlboro men riding into the sunset? Crest has been fighting cavities for so long they’re into their second generation of kids. Because of change, a company must think even more strategically than it did before.
> 
> With rare exceptions, a company should almost never change its basic positioning strategy. Only its tactics, those short-term maneuvers that are intended to implement a longterm strategy.
>
> ...
> 
> The line-extension trap is a good example. What you are really doing when you line-extend is weakening your basic position. And once that’s gone, you are adrift without an anchor.
>
> Levi’s line-extended into casual clothes. And then found its basic position in jeans undermined by “designer label” jeans.
>
> **6. Do you match your position?**
> 
> Creative people often resist positioning thinking because they believe it restricts their creativity.
> 
> And you know what? It does. Positioning thinking does restrict creativity.
> 
> “Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars, so why go with us? We try harder.” This doesn’t sound like an ad. It sounds like the presentation of the marketing strategy. In truth, it’s both.
> 
> Do your advertisements for yourself match your position? Do your clothes, for example, tell the world that you’re a banker or a lawyer or an artist?
> 
> Or do you wear creative clothes that undermine your position?
>
> Creativity by itself is worthless. Only when it is subordinated to the positioning objective can creativity make a contribution.
>
> **The role of the outsider**
> 
> The question sometimes arises: Do we do it ourselves or do we hire someone to position us?
>
> The someone that often gets hired is an advertising agency. An ad agency? Who needs help from those Madison Avenue hucksters?
> 
> Everybody. But only the rich can afford to hire an advertising agency. All the others have to learn how to do it themselves. Have to learn how to apply the invaluable ingredient only available from the outsider.
> 
> And what does the outsider supply? An ingredient called ignorance. In other words, objectivity.
> 
> By not knowing what goes on inside a company, the outsider is better able to see what is happening on the outside. In the mind of the prospect.
> 
> The outsider is naturally attuned to outside-in thinking, while the insider is more comfortable with inside-out thinking.
> 
> Objectivity is the key ingredient supplied by the advertising or marketing communication or public relations agency.
>
> **What the outsider doesn’t supply**
>
> In a word, magic. Some business managers believe that the role of an advertising agency is to wave a magic wand which causes prospects to immediately rush out and buy the product.
> 
> The wand, of course, is called “creativity,” a commodity much sought after by the neophyte advertiser.
> 
> The popular view is that the agency “creates.” And that the best agencies are filled with a substance called “creativity” which they liberally apply to their advertising solutions.
> 
> In advertising circles, the story is told about an advertising agency that was very creative. So creative, in fact, it could take straw and spin it into gold.
> 
> Now you might have heard of them because they had a very creative name. Rumplestiltskin, Inc.
> 
> The legend lives on. Even today, some people think agencies are so creative that they can spin straw into gold.
> 
> Not true. Advertising agencies can’t spin straw into gold. If they could, they’d be in the straw-spinning business and not the advertising business.
> 
> Today, creativity is dead. The name of the game on Madison Avenue is positioning.
