# Positioning: The Battle for your Mind

© 2001 Jack Trout and Al Ries

## Introduction

> We have become the world’s first overcommunicated society. Each year, we send more and receive less.
>
> ...
>
> Positioning starts with a product. A piece of merchandise, a service, a company, an institution, or even a person. Perhaps yourself.
> 
> But positioning is not what you do to a product. Positioning is what you do to the mind of the prospect. That is, you position the product in the mind of the prospect.
>
> So it’s incorrect to call the concept “product positioning.” You’re not really doing something to the product itself.
>
> Not that positioning doesn’t involve change. It often does. But changes made in the name, the price, and the package are really not changes in the product at all. They’re basically cosmetic changes done for the purpose of securing a worthwhile position in the prospect’s mind.
> 
> Positioning is the first body of thought that comes to grips with the difficult problem of getting heard in our overcommunicated society.

## Chapter 1. What Positioning is All About

> In the communication jungle out there, the only hope to score big is to be selective, to concentrate on narrow targets, to practice segmentation. In a word, “positioning.”
> 
> The mind, as a defense against the volume of today’s communications, screens and rejects much of the information offered it. In general, the mind accepts only that which matches prior knowledge or experience.
>
> ...
>
> In other words, since so little of your message is going to get through anyway, you ignore the sending side and concentrate on the receiving end. You concentrate on the perceptions of the prospect. Not the reality of the product.

## Chapter 2. The Assault on the Mind

> The Sunday edition of a large metropolitan newspaper like The New York Times weighs about 4½ pounds and contains some 500,000 words. To read it all, at an average reading speed of 300 words per minute, would take almost 28 hours. Not only would your Sunday be shot, but also a good part of the rest of the week too.
> 
> How much is getting through?
>
> ...
> 
> Which means the average American family is exposed to some 750,000 television pictures a day.
>
> Not only are we being pictured to death, we are being papered to death. Take that Xerox machine down the hall. American business processes 1.4 trillion pieces of paper a year. That’s 5.6 billion every working day.
>
> ...
>
> The assault on the mind takes place in many different ways. The U.S. Congress passes some 500 laws a year (that’s bad enough), but regulatory agencies promulgate some 10,000 new rules and regulations in the same amount of time.
> 
> And the regulatory agencies are not stingy with their words either. Consider this: The Lord’s Prayer contains 56 words; the Gettysburg Address, 266; the Ten Commandments, 297; the Declaration of Independence, 300; and a recent U.S. government order setting the price of cabbage, 26,911.
> 
> At the state level, over 250,000 bills are introduced each year. And 25,000 pass the legislatures to disappear into the labyrinths of the law.
> 
> Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Ignorance of the lawmakers apparently is. Our legislators continue to pass thousands of laws that you can’t possibly keep track of. And even if you could, you couldn’t possibly remember how a law might differ from one of our 50 states to another.
> 
> Who reads, sees, or listens to all this outpouring of communication?
> 
> There’s a traffic jam on the turnpikes of the mind. Engines are overheating. Tempers are rising.

## Chapter 3. Getting into the Mind

> The easy way to get into a person’s mind is to be first. You can demonstrate the validity of this principle by asking yourself a few simple questions.
>
> What’s the name of the first person to fly solo across the North Atlantic? Charles Lindbergh, right?
>
> Now, what’s the name of the second person to fly solo across the North Atlantic?

Hmm. I'm not too sure. But, I'm allowing this argument to play out.

> What’s the name of the highest mountain in the world? Mount Everest in the Himalayas, right?

Well, yeah. I definitely know this one.

> Not so in a mental contest. In a mental battle the odds favor the first person, the first product, the first politician to get into the mind of the prospect.
> 
> In advertising, the first product to establish the position has an enormous advantage. Xerox, Polaroid, Bubble Yum, to name a few more examples.
>
> ...
> 
> Today it has become obvious that advertising is entering a new era—an era where creativity is no longer the key to success.
> 
> The fun and games of the sixties and seventies have given way to the harsh realities of the eighties.
> 
> To succeed in our overcommunicated society, a company must create a position in the prospect’s mind, a position that takes into consideration not only a company’s own strengths and weaknesses, but those of its competitors as well.
> 
> Advertising is entering an era where strategy is king. In the positioning era, it’s not enough to invent or discover something. It may not even be necessary. You must, however, be first to get into the prospect’s mind.
>
> IBM didn’t invent the computer. Sperry-Rand did. But IBM was the first company to build a computer position in the mind of the prospect.
> 
> ...
>
> “First class is Michelob” positioned the brand as a premium-priced American-made beer. In a few years, Michelob became one of the largest-selling beers in the United States. At premium prices too.
> 
> Was Michelob the first premium-priced domestic beer? No, of course not. But Michelob was the first to build the position in the beer-drinker’s mind.

## Chapter 4. Those Little Ladders in Your Head

> The mind rejects new information that doesn’t “compute.” It accepts only that new information which matches its current state of mind. It filters out everything else.
>
> ...
>
> Ask two people of opposite persuasion, say, a Democrat and a Republican, to read an article on a controversial subject. Then ask each one if the article changed his or her opinion.
> 
> You’ll find that the Democrat gets out of the article facts to support one point of view. The Republican gets out of the same article facts to support the opposite point of view. Very little mind changing takes place. You see what you expect to see.
>
> ...
> 
> You taste what you expect to taste.
>
> Blind taste testings of champagne have often ranked inexpensive California brands above French ones. With the labels on, this is unlikely to happen.
> 
> You taste what you expect to taste.
>
> ...
>
> One prime objective of all advertising is to heighten expectations. To create the illusion that the product or service will perform the miracles you expect. And presto, that’s exactly what the advertising does.
>
> But create the opposite expectation and the product is in trouble. The introductory advertising for Gablinger’s beer created a feeling that because it was a diet product, it would taste bad.
>
> And sure enough, the advertising worked! People tried it and were easily convinced that it did taste bad. You taste what you expect to taste.
>
> ...
> 
> According to Harvard psychologist Dr. George A. Miller, the average human mind cannot deal with more than seven units at a time. Which is why seven is a popular number for lists that have to be remembered. Seven-digit phone numbers, the Seven Wonders of the World, seven-card stud, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
> 
> Ask someone to name all the brands he or she remembers in a given product category. Rarely will anyone name more than seven. And that’s for a high-interest category. For low-interest products, the average consumer can usually name no more than one or two brands.
> 
> ...
> 
> A competitor that wants to increase its share of the business must either dislodge the brand above (a task that is usually impossible) or somehow relate its brand to the other company’s position.
>
> ...
> 
> An advertiser who wants to introduce a new product category must carry in a new ladder. This, too, is difficult, especially if the new category is not positioned against the old one. The mind has no room for what’s new and different unless it’s related to the old.
> 
> That’s why if you have a truly new product, it’s often better to tell the prospect what the product is not, rather than what it is.
> 
> The first automobile, for example, was called a “horseless” carriage, a name which allowed the public to position the concept against the existing mode of transportation.
> 
> Words like “off-track” betting, “lead-free” gasoline, and “sugar-free” soda are all examples of how new concepts can best be positioned against the old.
>
> ...
> 
> “Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars, so why go with us? We try harder.”
>
> For 13 years in a row, Avis lost money. Then they admitted that they were No. 2 and Avis started to make money.
>
> ...
> 
> On each rung of the product ladder is a brand name. Hertz on top. Avis on the second rung. National on the third.
> 
> Many marketing people have misread the Avis story. They assume the company was successful because it tried harder.
> 
> Not at all. Avis was successful because it related itself to Hertz. (If trying harder were the secret of success, Harold Stassen would have been President many times over.)
>
> ...
> 
> Establishing the “against” position is a classic positioning maneuver. If a company isn’t the first, then it has to be the first to occupy the No. 2 position. It’s not an easy task.
> 
> But it can be done. What Avis is doing in rent-a-cars, Burger King is doing in fast foods, and Pepsi is doing in colas.
> 
> ...
> 
> By linking the product to what was already in the mind of the prospect, the “uncola” position established 7-Up as an alternative to a cola drink. (The three rungs on the cola ladder might be visualized as: One, Coke. Two, Pepsi, And three, 7-Up.)
>
> ...
> 
> To find a unique position, you must ignore conventional logic. Conventional logic says you find your concept inside yourself or inside the product.
> 
> Not true. What you must do is look inside the prospect’s mind.
> 
> You won’t find an “uncola” idea inside a 7-Up can. You find it inside the cola drinker’s head.
>
> More than anything else, successful positioning requires consistency. You must keep at it year after year.
>
> Yet after a company has executed a brilliant positioning coup, too often it falls into what we call the F.W.M.T.S. trap: “Forgot what made them successful.”
> 
> Shortly after the company was sold to ITT, Avis decided it was no longer satisfied with being No. 2. So it ran ads saying, “Avis is going to be No. 1.”
> 
> That’s advertising your aspirations. Wrong psychologically. And wrong strategically.
> 
> Avis was not destined to be No. 1 unless it could find a weakness in Hertz to exploit.
> 
> Furthermore, the old campaign not only related No. 2 Avis to No. 1 Hertz on the product ladder in the prospect’s mind, but also capitalized on the natural sympathy people have for the underdog.
> 
> The new campaign was just conventional brag-and-boast advertising.
