# Positioning: The Battle for your Mind

© 2001 Jack Trout and Al Ries

## Introduction

> We have become the world’s first overcommunicated society. Each year, we send more and receive less.
>
> ...
>
> Positioning starts with a product. A piece of merchandise, a service, a company, an institution, or even a person. Perhaps yourself.
> 
> But positioning is not what you do to a product. Positioning is what you do to the mind of the prospect. That is, you position the product in the mind of the prospect.
>
> So it’s incorrect to call the concept “product positioning.” You’re not really doing something to the product itself.
>
> Not that positioning doesn’t involve change. It often does. But changes made in the name, the price, and the package are really not changes in the product at all. They’re basically cosmetic changes done for the purpose of securing a worthwhile position in the prospect’s mind.
> 
> Positioning is the first body of thought that comes to grips with the difficult problem of getting heard in our overcommunicated society.

## Chapter 1. What Positioning is All About

> In the communication jungle out there, the only hope to score big is to be selective, to concentrate on narrow targets, to practice segmentation. In a word, “positioning.”
> 
> The mind, as a defense against the volume of today’s communications, screens and rejects much of the information offered it. In general, the mind accepts only that which matches prior knowledge or experience.
>
> ...
>
> In other words, since so little of your message is going to get through anyway, you ignore the sending side and concentrate on the receiving end. You concentrate on the perceptions of the prospect. Not the reality of the product.

## Chapter 2. The Assault on the Mind

> The Sunday edition of a large metropolitan newspaper like The New York Times weighs about 4½ pounds and contains some 500,000 words. To read it all, at an average reading speed of 300 words per minute, would take almost 28 hours. Not only would your Sunday be shot, but also a good part of the rest of the week too.
> 
> How much is getting through?
>
> ...
> 
> Which means the average American family is exposed to some 750,000 television pictures a day.
>
> Not only are we being pictured to death, we are being papered to death. Take that Xerox machine down the hall. American business processes 1.4 trillion pieces of paper a year. That’s 5.6 billion every working day.
>
> ...
>
> The assault on the mind takes place in many different ways. The U.S. Congress passes some 500 laws a year (that’s bad enough), but regulatory agencies promulgate some 10,000 new rules and regulations in the same amount of time.
> 
> And the regulatory agencies are not stingy with their words either. Consider this: The Lord’s Prayer contains 56 words; the Gettysburg Address, 266; the Ten Commandments, 297; the Declaration of Independence, 300; and a recent U.S. government order setting the price of cabbage, 26,911.
> 
> At the state level, over 250,000 bills are introduced each year. And 25,000 pass the legislatures to disappear into the labyrinths of the law.
> 
> Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Ignorance of the lawmakers apparently is. Our legislators continue to pass thousands of laws that you can’t possibly keep track of. And even if you could, you couldn’t possibly remember how a law might differ from one of our 50 states to another.
> 
> Who reads, sees, or listens to all this outpouring of communication?
> 
> There’s a traffic jam on the turnpikes of the mind. Engines are overheating. Tempers are rising.

## Chapter 3. Getting into the Mind

> The easy way to get into a person’s mind is to be first. You can demonstrate the validity of this principle by asking yourself a few simple questions.
>
> What’s the name of the first person to fly solo across the North Atlantic? Charles Lindbergh, right?
>
> Now, what’s the name of the second person to fly solo across the North Atlantic?

Hmm. I'm not too sure. But, I'm allowing this argument to play out.

> What’s the name of the highest mountain in the world? Mount Everest in the Himalayas, right?

Well, yeah. I definitely know this one.

> Not so in a mental contest. In a mental battle the odds favor the first person, the first product, the first politician to get into the mind of the prospect.
> 
> In advertising, the first product to establish the position has an enormous advantage. Xerox, Polaroid, Bubble Yum, to name a few more examples.
>
> ...
> 
> Today it has become obvious that advertising is entering a new era—an era where creativity is no longer the key to success.
> 
> The fun and games of the sixties and seventies have given way to the harsh realities of the eighties.
> 
> To succeed in our overcommunicated society, a company must create a position in the prospect’s mind, a position that takes into consideration not only a company’s own strengths and weaknesses, but those of its competitors as well.
> 
> Advertising is entering an era where strategy is king. In the positioning era, it’s not enough to invent or discover something. It may not even be necessary. You must, however, be first to get into the prospect’s mind.
>
> IBM didn’t invent the computer. Sperry-Rand did. But IBM was the first company to build a computer position in the mind of the prospect.
> 
> ...
>
> “First class is Michelob” positioned the brand as a premium-priced American-made beer. In a few years, Michelob became one of the largest-selling beers in the United States. At premium prices too.
> 
> Was Michelob the first premium-priced domestic beer? No, of course not. But Michelob was the first to build the position in the beer-drinker’s mind.

## Chapter 4. Those Little Ladders in Your Head

> The mind rejects new information that doesn’t “compute.” It accepts only that new information which matches its current state of mind. It filters out everything else.
>
> ...
>
> Ask two people of opposite persuasion, say, a Democrat and a Republican, to read an article on a controversial subject. Then ask each one if the article changed his or her opinion.
> 
> You’ll find that the Democrat gets out of the article facts to support one point of view. The Republican gets out of the same article facts to support the opposite point of view. Very little mind changing takes place. You see what you expect to see.
>
> ...
> 
> You taste what you expect to taste.
>
> Blind taste testings of champagne have often ranked inexpensive California brands above French ones. With the labels on, this is unlikely to happen.
> 
> You taste what you expect to taste.
>
> ...
>
> One prime objective of all advertising is to heighten expectations. To create the illusion that the product or service will perform the miracles you expect. And presto, that’s exactly what the advertising does.
>
> But create the opposite expectation and the product is in trouble. The introductory advertising for Gablinger’s beer created a feeling that because it was a diet product, it would taste bad.
>
> And sure enough, the advertising worked! People tried it and were easily convinced that it did taste bad. You taste what you expect to taste.
>
> ...
> 
> According to Harvard psychologist Dr. George A. Miller, the average human mind cannot deal with more than seven units at a time. Which is why seven is a popular number for lists that have to be remembered. Seven-digit phone numbers, the Seven Wonders of the World, seven-card stud, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
> 
> Ask someone to name all the brands he or she remembers in a given product category. Rarely will anyone name more than seven. And that’s for a high-interest category. For low-interest products, the average consumer can usually name no more than one or two brands.
> 
> ...
> 
> A competitor that wants to increase its share of the business must either dislodge the brand above (a task that is usually impossible) or somehow relate its brand to the other company’s position.
>
> ...
> 
> An advertiser who wants to introduce a new product category must carry in a new ladder. This, too, is difficult, especially if the new category is not positioned against the old one. The mind has no room for what’s new and different unless it’s related to the old.
> 
> That’s why if you have a truly new product, it’s often better to tell the prospect what the product is not, rather than what it is.
> 
> The first automobile, for example, was called a “horseless” carriage, a name which allowed the public to position the concept against the existing mode of transportation.
> 
> Words like “off-track” betting, “lead-free” gasoline, and “sugar-free” soda are all examples of how new concepts can best be positioned against the old.
>
> ...
> 
> “Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars, so why go with us? We try harder.”
>
> For 13 years in a row, Avis lost money. Then they admitted that they were No. 2 and Avis started to make money.
>
> ...
> 
> On each rung of the product ladder is a brand name. Hertz on top. Avis on the second rung. National on the third.
> 
> Many marketing people have misread the Avis story. They assume the company was successful because it tried harder.
> 
> Not at all. Avis was successful because it related itself to Hertz. (If trying harder were the secret of success, Harold Stassen would have been President many times over.)
>
> ...
> 
> Establishing the “against” position is a classic positioning maneuver. If a company isn’t the first, then it has to be the first to occupy the No. 2 position. It’s not an easy task.
> 
> But it can be done. What Avis is doing in rent-a-cars, Burger King is doing in fast foods, and Pepsi is doing in colas.
> 
> ...
> 
> By linking the product to what was already in the mind of the prospect, the “uncola” position established 7-Up as an alternative to a cola drink. (The three rungs on the cola ladder might be visualized as: One, Coke. Two, Pepsi, And three, 7-Up.)
>
> ...
> 
> To find a unique position, you must ignore conventional logic. Conventional logic says you find your concept inside yourself or inside the product.
> 
> Not true. What you must do is look inside the prospect’s mind.
> 
> You won’t find an “uncola” idea inside a 7-Up can. You find it inside the cola drinker’s head.
>
> More than anything else, successful positioning requires consistency. You must keep at it year after year.
>
> Yet after a company has executed a brilliant positioning coup, too often it falls into what we call the F.W.M.T.S. trap: “Forgot what made them successful.”
> 
> Shortly after the company was sold to ITT, Avis decided it was no longer satisfied with being No. 2. So it ran ads saying, “Avis is going to be No. 1.”
> 
> That’s advertising your aspirations. Wrong psychologically. And wrong strategically.
> 
> Avis was not destined to be No. 1 unless it could find a weakness in Hertz to exploit.
> 
> Furthermore, the old campaign not only related No. 2 Avis to No. 1 Hertz on the product ladder in the prospect’s mind, but also capitalized on the natural sympathy people have for the underdog.
> 
> The new campaign was just conventional brag-and-boast advertising.

## Chapter 5. You Cen't Get There from Here

> Today a company can have a great product, a great sales force, a great advertising campaign and still fail miserably if it happens to be in a position in which “you can’t get there from here.” No matter how many millions it is prepared to spend.
>
> ...
>
> A better strategy for IBM’s competitors would be to take advantage of whatever positions they already own in the minds of their prospects and then relate them to a new position in computers. For example, how should RCA have positioned its computer line?
> 
> Our 1969 article made a suggestion: “RCA is a leader in communications. If they positioned a computer line that related to their business in communications, they could take advantage of their own position. Even though they would be ignoring a great deal of business, they would be establishing a strong beachhead.”
>
> ...
>
> NCR has made great progress in the computer business by concentrating its efforts on retail data entry systems. Computerized cash registers, if you will.
> 
> Where the situation is hopeless, however, the effort in finding a valid position is probably wasted. Much better to concentrate on other areas of a company’s business. As Charlie Brown said, “No problem is too big to run away from.”

## Chapter 6. Positioning of a Leader

> Companies like Avis and Seven-Up found viable alternative positions to marketing leaders.
> 
> But most companies don’t want to be an also-ran, successful or not. They want to be a leader like Hertz or Coke.
> 
> So how do you get to be the leader? Actually it’s quite simple. Remember Charles Lindbergh and Neil Armstrong?
> 
> You just get there firstest with the mostest.
> 
> History shows that the first brand into the brain, on the average, gets twice the long-term market share of the No. 2 brand and twice again as much as the No. 3 brand. And the relationships are not easily changed.
> 
> The leader brand in category after category outsells the number two brand by a wide margin. Hertz outsells Avis, General Motors outsells Ford, Goodyear outsells Firestone, McDonald’s outsells Burger King, General Electric outsells Westinghouse.
> 
> Many marketing experts overlook the enormous advantages of being first. Too often they attribute successes like Kodak and IBM and Coke to “marketing acumen.”
>
> ...
>
> As long as a company owns the position, there’s no point in running advertisements that repeat the obvious. “We’re No. 1” is a typical example.
> 
> Much better is to enhance the product category in the prospect’s mind. IBM’s advertising usually ignores competition and sells the value of computers. All computers, not just the company’s types.
> 
> Why isn’t it a good idea to run advertising that says, “We’re No. 1”?
> 
> The reason is psychological. Either the prospect knows you are No. 1 and wonders why you are so insecure that you have to say so. Or the prospect doesn’t know you are No. 1. If not, why not?
> 
> ...
> 
> “The real thing.” This classic Coca-Cola advertising campaign is a strategy that can work for any leader.
> 
> The essential ingredient in securing the leadership position is getting into the mind first. The essential ingredient in keeping that position is reinforcing the original concept. Coca-Cola is the standard by which all others are judged. In contrast, everything else is an imitation of “the real thing.”
> 
> This is not the same as saying “We’re No. 1.” The largest brand could be the largest seller because it has a lower price, it is available in more outlets, etc.
> 
> But “the real thing,” like a first love, will always occupy a special place in the prospect’s mind.
> 
> “We invented the product.” A powerful motivating force behind Xerox copiers. Polaroid cameras. Zippo lighters.
>
> ...
>
> This means a leader should swallow his or her pride and adopt every new product development as soon as it shows signs of promise.
> 
> General Motors spent $50 million to cover the Wankel engine when it was offered to the automotive industry. Money down the drain? Not necessarily.
> 
> General Motors probably looks on the $50 million spent to buy a Wankel license as cheap insurance to protect an $84 billion-a-year business.
> 
> Suppose the Wankel had become the automotive engine of the future. And Ford or Chrysler had been the first to buy the rights. Where would General Motors be now?
> 
> Right where Kodak and 3M are in office copiers. When these two leaders in coated-paper copiers had a chance to cover by buying rights to Carlson’s xerography process, they declined.
> 
> “Nobody would pay 5 cents for a plain-paper copy when they could get a coated-paper copy for a cent and a half.” Logical enough. But the essence of covering is protection against the unexpected.
> 
> And the unexpected did happen. Haloid took a chance on the Carlson patents, and today the company (successively Haloid Xerox and then Xerox) is a $9 billion giant. Bigger than 3M and only a step behind Kodak. Fortune calls the Xerox 914 plain-paper copier “probably the single most profitable product ever manufactured in the United States.”
> 
> And what did Xerox do for an encore?
> 
> Almost nothing. The spectacular success of the 914 was followed by one failure after another. Most notably in computers.
>
> ...
> 
> ***The power of the organization is derived from the power of the product, the position that the product owns in the prospect’s mind.***
>
> ...
> 
> Each brand is uniquely positioned to occupy a certain location in the mind of the prospect. When times change, when new products come and go, no effort is made to change the position. Rather a new product is introduced to reflect changing technologies and changing tastes.
> 
> In other words, Procter & Gamble recognizes the enormous difficulty of moving an established position. When you have one already established, why change it? It may be cheaper and more effective in the long run to introduce a new product. Even if you eventually have to kill off an old, established name.
>
> Ivory was a soap. It still is. When heavy-duty laundry detergents became available, the pressure was probably on to introduce Ivory Detergent. But this would have meant changing the position of Ivory in the prospect’s mind.
> 
> A much better solution was Tide. Now the new detergent concept had a new name to match. And Tide became an enormous success.
> 
> And when Procter & Gamble introduced a dishwasher detergent, they didn’t call it Dishwasher Tide. They called it Cascade.
> 
> Each leading Procter & Gamble brand has its own separate identity: Joy, Crest, Head & Shoulders, Sure, Bounty, Pampers, Comet, Charmin, and Duncan Hines. Not a Plus, Ultra, or Super in the lot.

## Chapter 7. Positioning of a Follower

> What works for a leader doesn’t necessarily work for a follower. Leaders can often cover a competitive move and retain their leadership.
> 
> But followers are not in the same position to benefit from a covering strategy. When a follower copies a leader, it’s not covering at all. It’s better described as a me-too response. (Usually phrased more diplomatically as “keeping in tune with the times.”)
> 
> Most products fail to achieve reasonable sales goals because the accent is on “better” rather than “speed.” That is, the No. 2 company thinks the road to success is to introduce a me-too product, only better.
> 
> It’s not enough to be better than the competitor. You must introduce your product before someone else has a chance to establish leadership. With a more massive advertising and promotion launch. And a better name. (More on this point later.)
>
> Yet the opposite normally occurs. The me-too company wastes valuable time on improving the product. Then the launch is made with a smaller advertising budget than the leader’s. And then the new product is given the house name, because that’s the easy way to ensure a quick share of market. All deadly traps in our overcommunicated society.
>
> How do you find an open position in the prospect’s mind?
>
> The French have a marketing expression that sums up this strategy rather neatly.
>
> Cherchez le creneau. “Look for the hole.”
>
> Cherchez le creneau and then fill it.
>
> That advice goes against the “bigger and better” philosophy ingrained into the American spirit.
> 
> Another typically American attitude makes positioning thinking difficult. Ever since childhood, we have been taught to think in a certain way.
> 
> “The power of positive thinking,” Norman Vincent Peale called it. An attitude which may sell a lot of books but which can destroy a person’s ability to find a creneau.
> 
> To find a creneau, you must have the ability to think in reverse, to go against the grain. If everyone else is going east, see if you can find your creneau by going west. A strategy that worked for Christopher Columbus can also work for you.
> 
> Let’s explore some strategies for finding creneaus.

### The size creneau

> For years, Detroit automakers were on a longer, lower kick. Each model year, cars became more streamlined, better looking.
> 
> Enter the Volkswagen Beetle. Short, fat, and ugly.
> 
> The conventional way to promote the Beetle would have been to minimize the weaknesses and maximize the strengths.
> 
> “Let’s get a fashion photographer who can make the car look better than it is. Then we’ll play up the reliability angle,” is your ordinary strategy.
> 
> But the creneau was size. The most effective ad Volkswagen ever ran was the one which stated the position clearly and unequivocally.
> 
> “Think small.”
> 
> With two simple words, this headline did two things at once. It stated the Volkswagen position, and it challenged the prospect’s assumption that bigger is necessarily better.
> 
> The effectiveness of this approach, of course, depends on the existence of an open creneau in the prospect’s mind. Not that there weren’t other small cars on the market at the time the Beetle was introduced. There were, but no one else had preempted the small-car position.

### The high-price creneau

> The classic example is Michelob. The people at Anheuser-Busch found an untapped market for a premium-priced domestic beer. And they moved into the mind with the Michelob name.
> 
> High-price creneaus seem to be opening up in many product categories. As our throwaway society sees the urgent need for conversation, there’s a new appreciation of a quality product designed to last.
> 
> Which is one reason behind the success of $40,000 automobiles like the BMW 635-CS and $50,000 cars like the Mercedes-Benz 500-SEL.
> 
> And S. T. Dupont (nice name) lighters at, as the ads say, “$1500 and down.”
> 
> Price is an advantage, especially if you’re the first in the category to establish the high-price creneau.
>
> ...
> 
> High price is effective not only for luxury items like cars, perfume, and watches, but also mundane products like Whitney’s Yogurt and Orville Redenbacher’s Gourmet Popping Corn.

### The low-price creneau

> Instead of high price, the opposite direction can also be a profitable tack to take.
>
> In evaluating price as a possible creneau, keep in mind that the low-price creneau is often a good choice for new products like facsimile equipment and videotape players. Products customers believe they are taking a chance on. (If the thing doesn’t work right, I’m not out that much money.)
> 
> The high-price creneau is often a good choice for old, established products like automobiles, watches, and television sets. Especially those products for which customers are not happy with existing repair services.
>
> The recent introduction of generic (“no name”) food brands is an attempt to exploit the low-price creneau in the supermarket. (Although retailer emphasis on sales and low prices over the years have pretty much wiped out the opportunities in that direction.)

### The gender-biased creneau

> Sex is one. Marlboro was the first national brand to establish a masculine position in cigarettes, one reason why Phillip Morris’s Marlboro brand has climbed steadily in sales. From fifth place in sales to first place in a 10-year period.
> 
> Timing is critical. In 1973 Lorillard tried to introduce its own masculine brand called Luke. The name was terrific, the packaging was great, the advertising was brilliant. “From Kankakee to Kokomo along comes Luke movin’ free and slow.”
> 
> The only thing wrong was the timing. About 20 years too late. Luke really was movin’ slow, so Lorillard killed him.
> 
> In positioning a product, there’s no substitute for getting there first.
>
> ...
> 
> When you use sex to segment a product category and establish a position, the obvious approach isn’t always the best.
> 
> Take perfume, for example. You’d think that the more delicate and feminine the brand, the more successful it would be. So what’s the largest-selling brand of perfume in the world?
> 
> No, it’s not Arpege or Chanel No. 5. It’s Revlon’s Charlie. The first brand to try a masculine name complete with pantsuit ads.

### The age-biased creneau

> Age is another positioning strategy to use. Geritol tonic is a good example of a successful product aimed at older folks.
> 
> Aim toothpaste is a good example of a product aimed at children. Aim has carved out 10 percent of the toothpaste market. A tremendous accomplishment in a market dominated by two powerful brands, Crest and Colgate.

### The time of day creneau

> Time of day is also a potential positioning possibility. Nyquil, the first night-time cold remedy, is one example.

### The distribution channel creneau

> Distribution is another possibility. L’eggs was the first hosiery brand to be distributed in supermarkets and mass merchandise outlets. L’eggs now is the leading brand, with sales in the hundreds of millions.

### The Factory Mistake

> One common mistake in looking for creneaus is filling a hole in the factory rather than one in the mind.
>
> Ford’s Edsel is the classic example. In the laughter that followed the demise of poor Edsel, most people missed the point.
> 
> In essence, the Ford people got switched around. The Edsel was a beautiful case of internal positioning to fill a hole between Ford and Mercury on the one hand and Lincoln on the other hand.
> 
> Good strategy inside the factory. Bad strategy outside where there was simply no position for this car in a category already cluttered with heavily chromed, medium-priced cars.
> 
> If the Edsel had been tagged a “high-performance” car and presented in a sleek two-door, bucket-seat form and given a name to match, no one would have laughed. It could have occupied a position that no one else owned, and the ending of the story might have been different.
> 
> Another “fill-the-factory” mistake was the National Observer, the first national weekly newspaper.
> 
> Dow Jones, the Observer’s proud parent, also publishes The Wall Street Journal, but only 5 days a week. Voilà, you can hear somebody say. Let’s fill the factory with a weekly newspaper. That way, we get free use of those expensive Journal presses.
> 
> But where was the hole in the prospect’s mind? He or she could already subscribe to Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report, and other news magazines.
>
> Aah, you say. But the National Observer is a weekly newspaper, not a magazine. But that’s playing semantic games. Prospects didn’t differentiate between the two.

### The Technology Trap

> Even a great technical achievement of a research laboratory will fail if there is no creneau in the mind.
> 
> In 1971 Brown-Forman Distillers launched Frost 8/80, the first “dry, white whisky.”
>
> Frost 8/80 should have been a big success. There was a big hole there. There was no other dry, white whisky. As Brown-Forman president William F. Lucas said, “It was greeted with great applause by our people and a gnashing of teeth by our competitors.”
> 
> Yet less than 2 years later, Frost 8/80 was dead. A multimillion-dollar failure. Volume had totaled just 100,000 cases, one-third of the company’s projections.
> 
> What went wrong? Look at the positioning claim from the prospect’s point of view.
> 
> The first white whisky? Not true. There are at least four others. Their names are gin, vodka, rum, and tequila.
> 
> As a matter of fact, Frost 8/80 ads encouraged the prospect to look at the new whisky as a substitute for other distilled spirits. According to the ads, Frost 8/80 could be used like vodka or gin in martinis, like scotch or bourbon in manhattans and whisky sours.
> 
> Don’t try to trick the prospect. Advertising is not a debate. It’s a seduction.
> 
> The prospect won’t sit still for the finer points of verbal logic. As the politician said, “If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, I say it’s a duck.”

### The Everybody Trap

> Some marketing people reject the “cherchez le creneau” concept. They don’t want to be tied down to a specific position because they believe it limits their sales. Or their opportunities.
> 
> They want to be all things to all people.
> 
> Years ago, when there were a lot fewer brands and a lot less advertising, it made sense to try to appeal to everybody.
> 
> In politics it used to be suicide for a politician to take a strong position on anything. Don’t step on anybody’s toes.
> 
> But today in the product arena and in the political arena, you have to have a position. There are too many competitors out there. You can’t win by not making enemies, by being everything to everybody.
> 
> To win in today’s competitive environment, you have to go out and make friends, carve out a specific niche in the market. Even if you lose a few doing so.
> 
> Today the everybody trap may keep you afloat if you’re already in office or already own a substantial share of market. But it’s deadly if you want to build a position from nowhere.

## Chapter 8. Repositioning the competition

> There comes a time when you can’t find a creneau. With hundreds of variations in each product category on the market, the chances of finding an open hole today are very slim.
> 
> For example, take your average supermarket, with 12,000 different products or brands on display. That means a young person has to sort out and catalog 12,000 different names in his or her head.
> 
> When you consider that the average college graduate has a speaking vocabulary of only 8000 words, you can see the problem.
> 
> The kid spends 4 years in a university and ends up 4000 words down.
>
> ...
> 
> Because there are so few creneaus to fill, a company must create one by repositioning the competitors that occupy the positions in the mind.
> 
> In other words, to move a new idea or product into the mind, you must first move an old one out.
> 
> “The world is round,” said Christopher Columbus. “No, it’s not,” said the public, “it’s flat.”
> 
> To convince the public otherwise, fifteenth century scientists first had to prove that the world wasn’t flat. One of their more convincing arguments was the fact that sailors at sea were first able to observe the tops of the masts of an approaching ship, then the sails, then the hull. If the world were flat, they would see the whole ship at once.
>
> ...
> 
> Tylenol went out and burst the aspirin bubble.
>
> “For the millions who should not take aspirin,” said Tylenol’s ads. “If your stomach is easily upset … or you have an ulcer … or you suffer from asthma, allergies, or iron-deficiency anemia, it would make good sense to check with your doctor before you take aspirin.
> 
> “Aspirin can irritate the stomach lining,” continued the Tylenol ad, “trigger asthmatic or allergic reactions, cause small amounts of hidden gastrointestinal bleeding.
> 
> “Fortunately, there is Tylenol …”
> 
> Sixty words of copy before any mention of the advertiser’s product.

Reminds me of understanding the stages of the buyer's journey by first identifying the customer's problem.

> Sales of Tylenol acetaminophen took off. Today Tylenol is the No. 1 brand of analgesic. Ahead of Anacin. Ahead of Bayer. Ahead of Bufferin. Ahead of Excedrin. A simple but effective repositioning strategy did the job.
>
> Against an institution like aspirin. Amazing.
>
> ...
>
> “Most American vodkas seem Russian,” said the ads. And the captions said: “Samovar: Made in Schenley, Pennsylvania. Smirnoff: Made in Hartford, Connecticut. Wolfschmidt: Made in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.
> 
> “Stolichnaya is different. It is Russian,” continued the ad. And the bottle is labeled, “Made in Leningrad, Russia.”
> 
> Stolichnaya sales began to soar as a result. Needless to say.
> 
> But why the need to disparage the competition? Couldn’t PepsiCo, the importers of the Stolichnaya brand, have simply advertised it as the “Russian vodka?”
> 
> They could have, of course. But that presumes a degree of product interest on the part of the vodka buyer that just doesn’t exist.
> 
> How many times have you picked up a bottle of liquor and read the label to find out where it was made? Furthermore, the names themselves (Samovar, Smirnoff, Wolfschmidt, Popov, Nikolai) imply a Russian origin. It’s this latter factor alone that was responsible for much of Stolichnaya’s astounding success.

> People like to see the high and mighty exposed. Note how other vodka ads play into Stolichnaya’s hands.

> The success of the Tylenol, Scope, Royal Doulton, and other repositioning programs has spawned a host of similar advertising. Too often, however, these copycat campaigns have missed the essence of repositioning strategy.
> 
> “We’re better than our competitors” isn’t repositioning. It’s comparative advertising and not very effective. There’s a psychological flaw in the advertiser’s reasoning which the prospect is quick to detect. “If your brand is so good, how come it’s not the leader?”
> 
> A look at comparative ads suggests why most of them aren’t effective. They fail to reposition the competition.
> 
> Rather, they use the competitor as a benchmark for their own brand. Then they tell the reader or viewer how much better they are. Which, of course, is exactly what the prospect expects the advertiser to say.

> “Ban is more effective than Right Guard, Secret, Sure, Arrid Extra Dry, Mitchum, Soft & Dry, Body All, and Dial,” said a recent Ban ad. The reader looks at an ad like this and asks, “What else is new?”

> In the past advertising was prepared in isolation. That is, you studied the product and its features, and then you prepared advertising which communicated to your customers and prospects the benefits of those features. It didn’t make much difference whether the competition offered those features or not.
> 
> In the traditional approach, you ignored competition and made every claim seem like a preemptive claim. Mentioning a competitive product, for example, was considered not only bad taste but poor strategy as well.
> 
> In the positioning era, however, the rules are reversed. To establish a position, you must often not only name competitive names but also ignore most of the old advertising rules as well.
> 
> In category after category, the prospect already knows the benefits of using the product. To climb on his or her product ladder, you must relate your brand to the brands already in the prospect’s mind.
> 
> Yet repositioning programs, even though effective, have stirred up a host of complaints. Many advertising people deplore the use of such tactics.

> Culture and refinement may be admirable qualities, but not in advertising.
>
> Is society sick when people are ready to believe the worst about a product or person, but balk about believing the best?
> 
> Are newspapers wrong to put the bad news on the front page and the good news in the back along with the society columns? (If they print any at all.)
> 
> The communication industry is like gossip. It feeds on the bad news, not the good.
> 
> It may not be your idea of the way things should be. It just happens to be the way things are.
> 
> To be successful in this overcommunicated society of ours, you have to play the game by the rules that society sets. Not your own.
> 
> Don’t be discouraged. A little disparagement may be preferable in the long run to a lot of conventional “brag and boast.”
> 
> Done honestly and fairly, it keeps the competition on their toes.
